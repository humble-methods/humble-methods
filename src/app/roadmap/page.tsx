Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest Fully in Stocks</h2>\n<p>First, I'd make sure I was <strong>100% invested in stocks</strong>. I'll tell you why in a minute.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Annual Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>Next, I'd <strong>draw down about 6% annually</strong>, netting about $100,000 a year post-tax.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Social Security Benefits</h2>\n<p>I'd take my <strong>social security at age 62</strong>, bringing in another $20,000 a year post-tax.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Investment Strategy</h2>\n<p>Next, I would remind you that I am not out of my mind. As legendary investor <strong>Peter Lynch</strong>, one of the only investors in history who could and did beat the market on an annual basis, he ran the numbers himself and showed that by staying <strong>100% in stocks</strong>, you could withdraw up to <strong>7% per year</strong> and still have a 96% chance of not running out of money.</p>\n<p>And as I'd be drawing only 6%, my portfolio would most likely continue to grow as my time on this earth would continue to shrink.</p>",\n  "tags": ["retirement planning", "investment strategies", "financial independence", "portfolio management", "social security"]\n}`
