  "content": "<h1>Worried About Investing? Understanding Your Protection with SIPC Insurance</h1>\n<p>If you are concerned about investing because your investments aren't <strong>FDIC insured</strong>, here are three things that might help you sleep better at night. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you navigate your investing journey.</p>\n\n<h2>1. SIPC Insurance Coverage</h2>\n<p>Your investments actually are covered by what's called <strong>SIPC insurance</strong> (Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance). This insurance provides coverage up to <strong>$500,000</strong> per customer, with a <strong>$250,000</strong> limit for cash holdings, similar to the FDIC.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Additional Private Insurance</h2>\n<p>Additionally, most major brokerage firms are also privately insured by <strong>Lloyd's of London</strong>, which extends your coverage should that firm become financially insolvent.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Ownership of Investments</h2>\n<p>Finally, even if your brokerage firm does become financially insolvent, they do not own those investments; you do. Your investments are held in what's known as <strong>street name</strong>, meaning you can usually transfer those investments to another brokerage firm should your current brokerage firm face insolvency.</p>\n\n<p>But just to clarify, none of this protects you against losing money in the market; it only provides coverage if the firm itself becomes financially insolvent.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
