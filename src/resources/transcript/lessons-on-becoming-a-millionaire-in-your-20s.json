  "content": "<h1>3 Important Lessons for Becoming a Millionaire by Your 20s</h1>\n<p>Here are the three things that I wish someone had told me in my 20s about becoming a millionaire. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free so you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Commit a Percentage of Your Income</h2>\n<p>Commit <strong>15%</strong> of each one of your paychecks to a brokerage account or a retirement account. Honestly, it doesn\u2019t really matter which account you choose, because each has its own advantages down the road.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Diversify Your Investments</h2>\n<p>Regardless of which account you choose, invest <strong>80%</strong> of that money in a <strong>total U.S. stock market fund</strong>, <strong>10%</strong> in a <strong>total international stock market fund</strong>, and <strong>10%</strong> in a <strong>money market fund</strong> for emergency scenarios.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Don\u2019t Overthink It</h2>\n<p>Now, never look at the account again, turn on investing news, or do anything that would derail the only tried and true way to become a millionaire: by being as boring and lazy as possible. And I\u2019m pretty boring and lazy!</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
