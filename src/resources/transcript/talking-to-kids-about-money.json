  "content": "<h1>3 Things to Remember When Talking to Your Kid About Money</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Break the Money Script</h2>\n<p>You don't need to pass your own money script down the line. Just because you suffered through tense conversations, or lack thereof, doesn’t mean your kids need to inherit that same anxiety. Trust me, they’re listening.</p>\n\n<h2>2. It's Okay to Say, \"I Don't Know\"</h2>\n<p>Think about the best teacher you ever had. Were they the ones who pretended to know everything and came off as egotistical ding-dongs? Or were they the ones who acknowledged good points and worked with you to figure out the right answer? It’s okay to model curiosity and honesty.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Give Them Real Money to Manage</h2>\n<p>If you really want to help your kids, give them small amounts of money early, and work with them to learn how to appreciate it, invest it, and spend it. Have them invest in companies that they can know, see, and touch. Learning by doing will always be more valuable than lectures, especially when they might forget your advice after five minutes.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
