  "content": "<p>Tyler? Yep. Looks like your children both have IRAs that will be worth $63,000 by the time they're 18, and just over $3.7 million by the time they're 60?</p>\n\n<p>Yep. How is that legal?</p>\n\n<p>It's a custodial Roth IRA. No age limit, as long as they have earned income. What earned income could they possibly have?</p>\n\n<p>My daughter manages my social media account, and my son distributes flyers for all of my speaking events.</p>\n\n<p>Well, good thing we get to tax those contributions at your 35% tax rate.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry, contributions are usually taxed at the child's rate, which is closer to 10%.</p>\n\n<p>Well, they can't touch those contributions until 59 and a half.</p>\n\n<p>It's a Roth IRA. They can take back the contributions whenever they want. They could even take up to $10,000 of earnings to help fund their first house, as long as the account has been open and funded for five years.</p>\n\n<p>So we get 10% of what my children make now, and 0% of the millions they'll have when they retire.</p>\n\n<p>Hmm. Well, see you later.</p>",
