  "content": "<h1>Six Effective Strategies for Wealth Building as a 40-Year-Old Couple</h1>\n<p>Hello, I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content to share valuable insights for free.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Understand Your Income</h2>\n<p>Assume we make $180,000 a year pre-tax, which translates to about $135,000 post-tax.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Max Out Retirement Accounts</h2>\n<p>Each of us should max out our Roth 401(k)s annually with $23,000, totaling $46,000.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Calculate Living Expenses</h2>\n<p>This leaves us with $90,000 a year for living expenses and savings.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Invest in a Taxable Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>We would then allocate an additional $10,000 a year to a taxable brokerage account and invest it in low-cost index funds.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Project Future Growth</h2>\n<p>Assuming a 7% annual rate of return, by age 65, our Roth 401(k)s are projected to have grown to about $2.9 million, and our brokerage account to about $632,000.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Plan for Retirement Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>Now at retirement, drawing down 6% annually results in over $212,000 a year, most of it tax-free.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
