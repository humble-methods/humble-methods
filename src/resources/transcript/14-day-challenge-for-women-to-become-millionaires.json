  "content": "<h1>14-Day Challenge for Women: Become a Millionaire Before Your 30s</h1>\n<p>If you are a woman in your 30s and you want to be a millionaire before the man sitting next to you, then you need to take the following 14-day challenge.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>In the next 14 days, commit to opening a Roth IRA. You can do this through Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard. It will take you just five minutes.</p>\n<p>Fund that Roth with <strong>$3.47 a day</strong>. If you do that in your 20s, you could be a millionaire by 65. If you wait until your 30s, you will need to put in <strong>$9.20 a day</strong>.</p>\n<p>Remember, if you funded that account with post-tax dollars in your 20s, all 45 years of that compound growth comes out tax-free!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Commit to Cash Only</h2>\n<p>For the next 14 days, commit to buying every single thing with cash. Yes, I know, cash can feel like a relic, but put away your credit card!</p>\n<p>Cut up your debit card and say goodbye to Venmo or PayPal. If you see every dollar leaving your hand, I promise you will find the <strong>$3.47 a day</strong> that can be allocated to that Roth.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Track Every Purchase</h2>\n<p>Write down every single purchase you make over the next 14 days. This exercise will help you find something on that list that you can truly cross off and live without.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Delay Large Purchases</h2>\n<p>If you're looking to purchase anything over <strong>$50</strong>, commit to taking a <strong>24-hour breathing and reflecting period</strong> before making that purchase.</p>\n<p>Sure, that item may be appealing, but being super wealthy and able to afford 20 of those items off of interest alone is far nicer!</p>\n\n<p>Complete this 14-day challenge, and I give you my personal guarantee that it will change your life.</p>",
