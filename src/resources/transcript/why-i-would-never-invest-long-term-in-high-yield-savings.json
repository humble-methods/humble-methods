  "content": "<h1>3 Reasons to Avoid Long-Term Investing in High-Yield Savings Accounts</h1>\n<p>Here are three reasons why I would never invest for the long-term in a high-yield savings account. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to guide you through essential investment concepts.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Guaranteed Loss of Wealth</h2>\n<p>Inflation and taxes will ultimately outpace the interest rates, even those from high-yield savings accounts. This means you're losing <strong>purchasing power</strong> every year that your money sits in that account.</p>\n\n<h2>2. It’s Not an Investment</h2>\n<p>While a high-yield savings account might offer you <strong>4% to 5%</strong> today, you haven’t bought any actual assets. You're barely keeping pace with inflation and taxes, and in many cases, you may not be keeping up at all.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Opportunity Cost</h2>\n<p>By keeping your money in a savings account, you're missing out on the opportunity to invest in the markets, where your money could A) buy assets and B) earn <strong>7% to 8%</strong> per year post-inflation. Yes, investing does come with risks. However, you know what's even riskier for your long-term financial wellbeing? Not investing at all.</p>\n\n<p>If you find any of this information helpful, please like and follow, and I'll continue sharing insights to help you get one step closer to your financial objectives.</p>",
