  "content": "<h1>Retirement Myths Debunked: You Don't Need $5 Million to Retire</h1>\n<p>If you think you need $5 million just to retire, you've been lied to. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<p>Retirement is not about hitting an arbitrary number. It's about <strong>cash flow</strong>. Here's what I mean.</p>\n<p>Most people think that they need a huge nest egg because they're planning to withdraw only 4% a year. This rule was created decades ago when bond yields were much higher and people were terrified of running out of money. While that fear hasn't really changed, here's the truth:</p>\n<p>If I were to stay <strong>100% invested in stocks</strong>, I can, according to the numbers, draw down <strong>up to 7% per year</strong> and still have over a <strong>96% chance</strong> of never running out of money.</p>\n<p>The point is this: You don't need millions to retire. You need the right strategy. If you want to see the math on how I've done this myself, sign up for my free newsletter, and I'll send you over some numbers this weekend.</p>",
