  "content": "<h1>Steps to Millionaire Status at 20</h1><p>If you are 20 years old and want to be the first millionaire in your family, then you need to do the following three things right now.</p><h2>1. Open a Roth IRA</h2><p>Open a Roth IRA with Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard. This will take you five minutes and you never have to use it if you don't want to.</p><h2>2. Save Consistently</h2><p>Now work your butt off to get $40 a week into that account. Zero excuses. Mow another lawn, babysit for a couple of hours, or wait tables on a Sunday morning. I don't care how you do it, just make it a top priority.</p><h2>3. Invest in Index Funds</h2><p>Once in that account, that $40 a week now needs to be invested into a low-cost index fund like Fidelity's FXAIX, Schwab's SWPPX, or Vanguard's VOO. This is how the money will grow.</p><h2>4. Commit to Your Goal</h2><p>Commit to doing this until you're 28 years old. You will most likely have a million bucks waiting for you at retirement, all for just $40 a week. The best part? Not one penny of that money will be taxed by the government because you were smart enough to do this in a Roth IRA when you were young and in a super low tax bracket.</p><p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
