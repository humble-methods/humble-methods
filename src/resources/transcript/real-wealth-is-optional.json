  "content": "<h1>Real Wealth is About Optionality, Not Just Net Worth</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Wealth vs. Freedom</h2>\n<p>You could have a <strong>$3 million</strong> portfolio, but if you can't take a weekday off without asking permission, you're not rich. You're a well-funded prisoner.</p>\n\n<h2>2. The Value of Optionality</h2>\n<p><strong>Optionality</strong> is the ability to pivot, to take a sabbatical, or to leave a job that drains you without having to explain to HR or your group chat.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Unlocking Your Net Worth</h2>\n<p>Your net worth could be impressive, but if itâ€™s all locked away in a <strong>401k</strong>, and you can't touch it for <strong>20 years</strong>, what are you actually optimizing for?</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Stop measuring wealth by arbitrary digits and start measuring it by decisions you don't have to justify to anyone other than yourself.</p>",
