  "content": "<h1>Top Five Things You Should Never Do Again After Working in Finance</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I work in finance, and my mom says I'm very special. So listen up.</p>\n<h2>Number 5: Stop Keeping Up with the Joneses</h2>\n<p>I would never again spend money trying to keep up with the Joneses. Wealth is always and forever what you do not show.</p>\n<h2>Number 4: Designate a Monthly Spending Account</h2>\n<p>I would designate a monthly spending account. Best savings account, spending account. And I would make sure to spend that money every single month on things that I truly cared about, namely experiences.</p>\n<h2>Number 3: Invest in Yourself</h2>\n<p>I would invest more in myself than in any other product. My learning, my business, my health. I'm stuck with myself 24-7 for the rest of my life. If I'm not operating at my best, I'm letting myself down.</p>\n<h2>Number 2: Don\u2019t Try to Outguess the Stock Market</h2>\n<p>I would never try to outguess the stock market. It cannot be done over a long time horizon, and anyone who says otherwise is lying.</p>\n<h2>Number 1: Relying on a Salary Job is Not the Answer</h2>\n<p>I would have stopped relying on the safety net of a salary job a long time ago. It is not a safety net; it is rather a chain that keeps you from doing the things that you need to do in life to become truly successful.</p>",
