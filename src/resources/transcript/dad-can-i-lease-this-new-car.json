I'm going to use that money to pay down our mortgage early.</p>\n<p><strong>How much does that save you?</strong></p>\n<p>If I put an additional $250 a month towards the principal, I will save about <strong>$50,000</strong> and take seven years off the mortgage.</p>\n<p>What will I drive? I heard <strong>e-bikes</strong> are very popular these days and good for the environment.</p>\n<p><strong>And where did you learn this?</strong></p>\n<p>Just follow <strong>Social Cap</strong>. He makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
