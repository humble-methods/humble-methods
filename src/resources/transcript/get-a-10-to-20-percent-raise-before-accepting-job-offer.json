  "content": "<h1>5 Essential Tips to Secure a 10-20% Raise Before Accepting Your Next Job Offer</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. After hiring about 300 people over the last three years, I've gathered five crucial strategies for negotiating your salary.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Expect Negotiation</h2>\n<p>As an employer, we always anticipate a negotiation phase. This means we won't provide our best and final offer right away.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Don't Fear Asking for More</h2>\n<p>Employers are not insulted if you ask for more money, as long as your request is within the published pay band.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Discuss Total Compensation</h2>\n<p>Employers have numerous ways to enhance your compensation package\u2014including salary, bonuses, job titles, vacation time, stock options, and job responsibilities. However, we won't utilize these levers unless you mention them. Focus on total compensation, not just your base salary.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Leverage Your Power</h2>\n<p>We want to hire you, not the second-best candidate. This is your moment of power to negotiate, so use it wisely.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Set the Stage with Your Numbers</h2>\n<p>Employers appreciate when candidates suggest a first salary figure. It's possible we were prepared to offer you significantly more, but now we don\u2019t have to reveal that figure. </p>\n\n<p>Instead of spending the next 20 to 30 years trying to negotiate small raises, ensure you never accept a position unless it offers you a 10-20% increase over the initial offer.</p>",
