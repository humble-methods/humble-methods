Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Going to the Dealership</h2>\n<p>Dealerships will do everything they can to wear you down and make you wait for hours until you're so sick of life that you'll buy that car for whatever price they say.</p>\n<h2>2. Spending Any Time Negotiating a Monthly Payment</h2>\n<p>The reason the finance person makes more money than anyone else at a car dealership is that they'll present you any monthly payment you want and make up for it tenfold by adjusting down payment, unnecessary fees, residual payments, or length of the lease or term payments. Focus solely on the MSRP whether buying or leasing.</p>\n<h2>3. Saying Yes to Anything the Finance Department Offers After the Deal Has Been Made</h2>\n<p>This is where the dealership makes higher profit margins than in any other area. Additional insurance and final add-ons are absurdly overpriced, and you can get all of those options through your own bank if you need them.</p>",
