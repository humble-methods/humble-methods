Looks like you made <strong>$100,000</strong> in your small business revenue this year, so you owe us. I'll save you the trouble.</p>\n\n<h2>Cost Breakdown</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>$50,000</strong> of that was cost of goods sold.</li>\n  <li><strong>$5,000</strong> of that was for my car lease payments. Don't worry, it's not my daily driver. Otherwise, I would deduct just the business portion of what I use.</li>\n  <li><strong>$5,000</strong> of that was for travel to see clients. This includes hotel fees, plane tickets, Wi-Fi, and meals with clients. I've got receipts.</li>\n  <li><strong>$5,000</strong> of that was for continuing education to maintain or improve my job skills.</li>\n  <li><strong>$15,000</strong> of that was for our office rental. Don't worry, it's not registered in my name. It's under our LLC.</li>\n  <li><strong>$5,000</strong> of that was for the computers and software we use for our business throughout the year.</li>\n  <li><strong>$10,000</strong> of that was for payroll expense because we have one W-2 employee who helped us to advertise.</li>\n  <li><strong>$4,601</strong> of that was actually on advertising, so that leaves <strong>$399</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>$1</strong> under when you'd owe us self-employment tax. We hadn't thought of that.</p>",
