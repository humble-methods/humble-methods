  "content": "<h2>Five Essential Things to Know Before Investing with Primerica or Ameriprise</h2>\n<p>Hi, I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free to help you save money on advice!</p>\n\n<h3>1. Franklin Global Equity Fund</h3>\n<p>You are likely invested in Franklin Global Equity Fund. This fund might seem appealing for tracking the S&P 500, but it costs you 55 times more than Fidelity's S&P 500 fund for the same performance.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Franklin Utilities Fund</h3>\n<p>Most likely, you hold shares in the Franklin Utilities Fund. For a more cost-effective option, consider SPDR's Utilities Fund (XLU), which saves you eight times more money and avoids the 3.75% upfront fee.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Putnam Core Equity Fund</h3>\n<p>This fund is often referred to as Core Equity but is essentially the S&P 500. It's crucial to identify less expensive alternatives.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Putnam Global Health Fund</h3>\n<p>Paying up to 5.75% upfront to invest in companies like Eli Lilly and UnitedHealth isn\u2019t healthy. Instead, explore Vanguard's low-cost health ETF (VHT) for the same investments at one-eighth the cost and no load fee.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Putnam Sustainable Leaders</h3>\n<p>Lastly, Putnam Sustainable Leaders charges excessively for names that sound appealing\u201430-55 times more to invest in top companies like Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft. Additionally, Putnam takes another 1% simply for having the opportunity to invest.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, focusing on low-cost index funds means you keep more of your hard-earned money. Invest wisely!</p>",
