Getting Too Conservative Too Quickly</h2>\n<p>Many retirees panic and shift everything into bonds, CDs, and cash. The problem? Inflation will destroy you. A $2 million portfolio in low-return assets could lose <strong>30 to 40%</strong> of its value in just <strong>10 to 15 years</strong>. Always consider mixing growth assets into your plan.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Taking Out Too Much Too Soon</h2>\n<p>Mathematically, the most important years to be quasi-frugal are the first few years of retirement because you potentially have the largest asset base you'll ever have. The smartest retirees do not blindly stick to a <strong>4% rule</strong> or even a <strong>6% rule</strong>. They withdraw based on market performance, spending just <strong>10 minutes a year</strong> checking their numbers.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Not Factoring in Long-Term Care Costs</h2>\n<p>This is one of the fastest ways to go from 60 to zero overnight. A private nursing home can cost over <strong>$100,000</strong> a year right now. Consider long-term care insurance, hybrid life policies, or setting aside enough money in a stable, liquid account like a money market fund to self-insure against future health risks.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio. Let's spend more than <strong>62 seconds</strong> exploring these topics together.</p>",
