  "content": "<h1>5 Fees That Could Sabotage Your Retirement with a Financial Advisor</h1>\n<p>If you're considering working with a financial advisor, you need to watch out for these five fees that absolutely could sabotage your retirement. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free, so you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Commissions</h2>\n<p>There are many self-proclaimed financial advisors with very little actual financial knowledge who will push products on you like <strong>annuities</strong> and <strong>whole life insurance</strong>. Why? Because they earn <strong>75% to 90%</strong> commissions on your first year\u2019s premium. Run for the hills.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Surrender Charges</h2>\n<p>What\u2019s that? You want to get out of that annuity you just purchased? Sorry, you most likely have to wait <strong>10 years</strong> to get out of it without paying a hefty fee. Keep running.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Trading Fees</h2>\n<p>Beyond the advisor\u2019s fee, if you\u2019re working with a broker dealer, you pay for every single trade they make. This frequent trading, or <strong>churning</strong>, is completely unethical.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Tax Drag</h2>\n<p>In taxable accounts, like a brokerage account, every sale for capital gains triggers a <strong>tax event</strong>. If your advisor is frequently selling your winners, your tax bill grows, while unsold unrealized gains are not taxed and can continue to grow.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Cash Drag</h2>\n<p>If your advisor is holding any of your assets in cash and telling you they are just waiting for the right time to invest your money, remember that you're still likely paying <strong>assets under management</strong> fees for that cash. It\u2019s eroding under inflation and fattening your advisor\u2019s wallet, not yours.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
