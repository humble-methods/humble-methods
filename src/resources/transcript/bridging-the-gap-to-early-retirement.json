  "content": "<h1>How to Bridge the Gap Between Early Retirement and Social Security</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Build a Taxable Brokerage Bridge Account</h2>\n<p>Your 401k or traditional IRA are locked until you’re 59 and a half, leaving most retirement savings inaccessible. To bridge the gap, plan to stash about five to seven years of expenses in a taxable brokerage account. I recommend investing 70% in <strong>VTI</strong>, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, and 30% in <strong>BND</strong>, the Vanguard Total Bond Market fund. This money is accessible anytime, with no penalties or restrictions.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Consider a Roth Conversion Ladder</h2>\n<p>Starting at 50, roll your 401k into a rollover IRA and convert chunks to a Roth each year. Paying taxes on the conversion now—when you’re likely in a lower marginal tax bracket—prepares you to pull out funds penalty and tax-free after five years. For example, convert $50,000 at 50 and pull it out at 55. Repeat by converting at 51, and pulling out at 56. This rinse-and-repeat strategy builds your tax-free wealth.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Utilize the Rule of 55</h2>\n<p>If you retire the year you turn 55 or later, you can withdraw penalty-free from your current employer's 401k while it stays in that specific plan. Just remember, rolling it over means waving goodbye to the Rule of 55.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
