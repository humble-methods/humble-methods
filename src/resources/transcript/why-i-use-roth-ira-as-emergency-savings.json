  "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Here are the three reasons I use my Roth IRA as my emergency savings account. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for this valuable information.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Access Your Contributions Anytime</h2>\n<p>Any money I contribute to my Roth IRA can be withdrawn anytime, penalty and tax free, similar to an emergency fund.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Potential for Growth</h2>\n<p>By investing those funds in my Roth IRA, my money can grow at about <strong>7%</strong> per year in real terms, compared to less than <strong>1%</strong> per year in a savings account. This offers a much greater cushion in case of emergency.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Consistent Savings Strategy</h2>\n<p>In my <strong>41 years</strong> on this planet, even during times of unemployment, I have committed my entire life to saving <strong>10%</strong> of each paycheck into these accounts. I have yet to experience, nor have I heard from friends, a situation that forced me to sell assets during a downturn.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This is why starting today, you need to <strong>pay yourself first</strong>. If you're not doing that, that's your emergency.</p>",
