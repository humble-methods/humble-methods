  "content": "<h1>5 Reasons I’m Taking My Social Security at 62</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Annual Benefits Reduction</h2>\n<p>Yes, my annual benefits would be reduced by <strong>5% to 6%</strong> per year. But you know what beats <strong>5% to 6%</strong> annually? The stock market.</p>\n\n<h2>2. The Importance of Early Access</h2>\n<p>If I don't invest the money, by taking it at <strong>62</strong> versus <strong>70</strong>, I still gain <strong>19 years</strong> of having more money overall. And I don't know what you all plan on doing after <strong>81</strong> years old, but I hope it’s a lavish party and I hope to see you all there!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Working After 62</h2>\n<p>If I want to keep working after <strong>62</strong>, yes, my benefits will be docked <strong>$1 for every $2</strong> I make over <strong>$23,400</strong> in <strong>2025</strong>. But at full retirement age, my benefits would be recalculated, and I’d get it all back.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Cost of Living Adjustments</h2>\n<p>Speaking of getting money back, Social Security benefits are adjusted each year for cost of living adjustments, which have averaged just over <strong>2%</strong> for the last 20 years. Unfortunately, inflation has averaged <strong>2.5%</strong> during that same timeframe, so I’ll take the money early while it’s still worth what I think it is.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Prioritizing Life Over Delaying</h2>\n<p>I’m simply done being told to defer life. <strong>Time is not money</strong>; money is time. I will use as much of my time as possible, as early as possible, to buy back my freedom.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you want to be considered for my contract bridge partner, I’ll be taking applications in the comments from now until the position is filled!</p>",
