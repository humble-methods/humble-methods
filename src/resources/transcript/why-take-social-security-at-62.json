  "content": "<h1>Why I'm Taking Social Security at 62: The Logic Behind It</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Understanding the Benefits</h2>\n<p>If I take Social Security at 62, I'm projected to receive <strong>$2,439</strong> a month. If I wait until 70, that check grows to <strong>$3,912</strong> a month. So why not wait until 70?</p>\n\n<h2>2. Monthly Payments vs. Long-Term Enjoyment</h2>\n<p>Because you just fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is never get involved in a land war in Asia. Probably slightly less well-known is this: never talk monthly payments when death is on the line.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Overall Money Until 79</h2>\n<p>By taking it at 62, I will have more money overall than by waiting until 70, at least until I reach 79 years old.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Longevity Considerations</h2>\n<p>Knowing I'm projected to die around 81, according to the world's finest actuarial tables, I have to ask myself: do I really want to gamble away 18 years of more travel, nicer dinners, and actually enjoying retirement just to possibly wait for a benefit increase at 85?</p>\n\n<h2>5. The Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It's up to you. Personally, I never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line. So all I've got to ask you is, who's coming with me?</p>\n\n<h2>Sign Up for More</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
