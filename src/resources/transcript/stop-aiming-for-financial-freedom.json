  "content": "<h1>Stop Aiming for Financial Freedom: Focus on Flexibility Instead</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Financial Freedom vs. Flexibility</h2>\n<p>Financial freedom gets thrown around like it's some type of mountain peak, but <strong>flexibility</strong> is way more useful. It's about being able to skip meetings without drama or take your kid to a random Tuesday matinee.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Measurable Freedom</h2>\n<p>Freedom is absurdly vague, whereas flexibility is measurable. Ask yourself: Can you take a month off? Can you change careers without panicking? Could you work part-time and still sleep at night?</p>\n\n<h2>3. Flexibility Doesn't Require Riches</h2>\n<p>You don't have to be rich to be flexible. You just have to stop committing your time to everyone else's priorities. Forget freedom as a destination; flexibly is the real superpower, and you can start building it right now.</p>",
