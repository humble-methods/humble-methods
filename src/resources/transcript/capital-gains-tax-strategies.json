  "content": "<p>Hey dad, is it true that you have over a million dollars in capital gains from your Apple stock?</p> <p>Yep, and I have some.</p> <p>Over my dead body.</p> <p>Okay, enough with the sarcasm. No, really, over my dead body. Once I die, you can have all of it. And you won't have to pay any capital gains taxes on any of it.</p> <p>Isn't that called tax evasion?</p> <p>Nope. The day that I die, all of the capital gains will get reset to zero. This is called <strong>cost-basis reset</strong>.</p> <p>You sell the stock for its current market value. You keep all the gains <em>tax-free</em>.</p> <p>Wow, who taught you this?</p> <p>I just follow Social Cat. He makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
