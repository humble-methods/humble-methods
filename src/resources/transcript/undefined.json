Financial Plan\",\"content\":\"<h1>How to Build Wealth in Your Twenties: A No B.S. Financial Plan</h1>\\n<p>Hey, I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I’m here to share my three-step plan on how to be rich and avoid being broke.</p>\\n<h2>Step 1: Understand Your Debt</h2>\\n<p>Start by figuring out what debt you'll pay down versus what debt you'll let ride. How do you do this? By comparing the interest on your debt to the return on the <strong>10-year U.S. Government Bond</strong>, also known as the risk-free rate.</p>\\n<p>If the interest on your debt is higher than the risk-free rate, prioritize paying it down. If it's lower, let the debt ride and consider investing your money either in the <strong>risk-free asset class</strong> or in an <strong>S&P 500 Fund</strong>.</p>\\n<h2>Step 2: Maximize Your 401(k) Match</h2>\\n<p>If your company offers a <strong>401(k) match</strong>, do everything you can to contribute just enough to get that full match. That’s essentially <strong>free money</strong>. For example, if you earn $50,000 a year and your company offers a 5% match, that equates to a substantial amount over time—around a quarter of a million dollars if invested long-term.</p>\\n<h2>Step 3: Invest in a Roth IRA</h2>\\n<p>Once you've taken advantage of the company match on your 401(k), I recommend not maxing it out. Instead, invest any additional funds into a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. At a young age, you're likely in a lower tax bracket and have more investment options than in the 401(k). Plus, you can withdraw your contributions at any time without penalties or taxes, unlike your 401(k).</p>\\n<p>If you found this advice helpful, consider signing up for my free newsletter linked in my bio.
