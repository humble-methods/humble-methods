I tried it.</p>\n<p> Tried what?</p>\n<p>Put my money in a Roth IRA. But then I couldn't help myself, so I took it back out in like two seconds.</p>\n<p>Uh oh, am I gonna get a penalty?</p>\n<p>I think it's time I told you the truth about Roth IRAs.</p>\n<p>See son, the money you put in has already been tapped. You can actually put the money in and take it back out as many times as you want, as quickly as you need. Penalty free.</p>\n<p>No 10% penalty?</p>\n<p>No 10% penalty.</p>\n<p>Nobody will think I'm any less of a financial planner.</p>\n<p>Well, they might. It's not the size of the account that matters; it's how you know how to use it.</p>",
