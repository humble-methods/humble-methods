Not even the professional jewelers who clean it once a year.</p>\n\n<h2>How Do You Sleep at Night?</h2>\n<p>I sleep knowing that I saved <strong>70%</strong> on that ring, and I didn\u2019t contribute to the profit margins of the world\u2019s most unethical monopolistic company.</p>\n\n<h2>De Beers and the Diamond Monopoly</h2>\n<p><strong>De Beers</strong>? They control over <strong>80%</strong> of the world\u2019s diamond supply, and most of those luxury gemstones are just sitting in a box somewhere to keep supply artificially low. This, in turn, keeps demand and price artificially high.</p>\n\n<h2>What If She Finds Out?</h2>\n<p>Let the world believe in its gods and its myths, son. It\u2019s all equally arbitrary.</p>",
