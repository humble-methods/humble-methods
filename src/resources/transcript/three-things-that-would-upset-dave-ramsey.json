  "content": "<h1>3 Spending Habits That Would Upset Dave Ramsey</h1>\n<p>What are three things you spend money on that would piss <strong>Dave Ramsey</strong> off? I'll go first. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free so you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Generous Tipping</h2>\n<p>Regardless of where I am or who is serving me, I leave <strong>25% tips</strong>, Dave. I\u2019m sorry, but when they turn that little flippy flip machine at me and then stare up into the sky like nothing awkward is happening, I feel like that\u2019s my ultimate judgment here on earth. Unless I leave the highest tip possible, I might never be welcome in another store or restaurant, either here or in the afterlife.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Impulse Grocery Spending</h2>\n<p>Because I have very little discipline and go to the supermarket when I'm absolutely starving, I end up spending an additional <strong>$50 a week</strong> on anything that meets the following criteria: it is <strong>salty</strong> and it is <strong>crunchy</strong>. If it passes those two tests, it\u2019s going to be in my cart regardless of why I went to the grocery store in the first place.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Quick Lunch Stops</h2>\n<p>Since I tend to work out in the morning, I\u2019m usually starving by lunchtime. The real problem, Dave, is that on the way to the grocery store, there\u2019s <strong>Jersey Mike's</strong>. And you know what you have to do when you pass a Jersey Mike's? You gotta stop at Jersey Mike's. And you know what you gotta do when you stop at Jersey Mike's? You gotta get a giant turkey provolone with bacon. That\u2019s another <strong>$20 a week</strong>, plus a <strong>25% tip</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If you relate to any of these spending habits, remember that it's important to balance generosity and indulgence with your financial goals!</p>",
