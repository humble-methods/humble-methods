Just invest your money in <strong>property A</strong>, and exchange it once it appreciates in value for <strong>property B</strong>. No taxes.</p>\n\n<h2>Reinvesting Gains</h2>\n<p>Is that why you keep using the money from one investment property to invest in a bigger property in a fancier neighborhood?</p>\n<p>Yep, and that\u2019s how I\u2019ve made taxes disappear for the last <strong>30 years</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Tax Implications of Selling</h2>\n<p>Yeah, but those deferred taxes will reappear when you sell the final property and don\u2019t exchange, right?</p>\n<p>Oh, that\u2019s the best part. I die, you inherit the property. In <strong>30 years</strong> of deferred capital gain? Poof! Disappear. Magic!</p>\n\n<h2>Stepped-Up Basis</h2>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s on a <strong>stepped-up basis</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Learning Resources</h2>\n<p>How did you learn about this?</p>\n<p>A magician never reveals his secrets, son. Just follow <strong>Social Cap</strong>; he makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
