  "content": "<h1>How to Pay Almost $0 in Taxes in Retirement</h1>\n<p>Here’s how I would pay almost <strong>$0</strong> in taxes in retirement. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Use Roth Conversions</h2>\n<p>First, use <strong>Roth conversions</strong> now to lower your tax bills later. If you retire in your <strong>60s</strong> like I'd like to, you have a tax sweet spot before you start claiming Social Security and before <strong>Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)</strong>. By converting your pre-tax accounts to a Roth while you're in this tax sweet spot, you can enjoy <strong>tax-free withdrawals</strong> for life.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Stay in the 0% Capital Gains Bracket</h2>\n<p>Second, stay in the <strong>0% capital gains bracket</strong> as long as it’s sustainable. If your taxable income stays under <strong>$96,700</strong> for those married filing jointly in <strong>2025</strong>, you pay <strong>zero</strong> in federal tax on long-term capital gains. Smart retirees sell investments strategically to maximize opportunities given in this tax-free window.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Leverage Tax-Free Income Sources</h2>\n<p>Lastly, leverage your <strong>tax-free income sources</strong>. This includes <strong>municipal bonds</strong> that are federal and sometimes even state tax-free, <strong>Roth IRA withdrawals</strong> (even though I don’t encourage that one), and <strong>health savings accounts (HSAs)</strong>. The biggest mistake retirees make isn’t how much money they have, but how much they keep in their own pockets.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
