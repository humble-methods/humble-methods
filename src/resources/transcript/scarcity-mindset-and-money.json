  "content": "<h1>Why Scarcity Mindset Doesn’t Disappear When You Make More Money</h1>\n<p>Fact: it often gets worse. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Feeling of Abundance is Fragile</h2>\n<p>When you grew up feeling like there was just never enough, even abundance feels fragile. For example, a <strong>$10,000</strong> emergency fund can feel like just barely getting by.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Stress Despite Wealth</h2>\n<p>You’ll find people with <strong>seven figures</strong> in the bank still stressing about groceries because fear does not care about your net worth.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Money Becomes a Hoarding Game</h2>\n<p>A scarcity mindset turns money into a hoarding game. You stop asking <strong>“What's this money for?”</strong> and start asking <strong>“How do I make sure I never lose it?”</strong> Remember that wealth is not just about the numbers; it's about knowing when you actually have enough to spend on what brings you joy.</p>",
