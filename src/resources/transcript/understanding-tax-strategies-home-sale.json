  "content": "<p>Hey dad, are we moving again to avoid paying taxes?</p>\n<p>Yep.</p>\n<p>But isn't that illegal?</p>\n<p>Nope. It's taking advantage of <strong>Section 121</strong> of the U.S. tax code.</p>\n<p>And is this just something you know about because you're super rich and privileged?</p>\n<p>Nope. Anybody can take advantage of this. You just need to have lived in the house for <strong>two of the last five years</strong>.</p>\n<p>And then when we sell it, we can exclude up to <strong>half a million dollars</strong> in capital gains.</p>\n<p>Oh, so is that why we move every two years to a bigger house in a fancier neighborhood?</p>\n<p>Yep. We haven't paid one dime of taxes on any of those capital gains in <strong>20 years</strong> while we've been building our family's net worth.</p>\n<p>Now how did you learn about this?</p>\n<p>Just follow <strong>Social Cap</strong>. He makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
