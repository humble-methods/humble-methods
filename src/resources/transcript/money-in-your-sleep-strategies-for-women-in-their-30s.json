  "content": "<h1>Empower Your Finances: Three Essential Strategies for Women in Their 30s</h1>\n<p>If you are a woman in your 30s and you want to start making money in your sleep, then you need to do the following three things today.</p>\n<p>And if any of this is helpful, remember to <strong>like and follow</strong>, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Start Saving for Retirement</h2>\n<p>First, you\u2019re going to start putting <strong>15%</strong> of every one of your paychecks directly into a <em>Roth IRA</em> or a <em>401k</em>. While men are usually advised to put only <strong>10%</strong>, it\u2019s crucial for women to save more as you typically live longer and currently have less in your retirement accounts.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest Wisely</h2>\n<p>Once that money is in the account, remember that it has to be invested to take advantage of <strong>compound growth</strong>. Consider investing in a low-cost index fund like <em>Fidelity\u2019s FXAIX</em> or, even better, a no-cost index fund like <em>Fidelity\u2019s FZROX</em>, which has literally <strong>0.0% in fees</strong>. This fund tracks <strong>2,500 of the world\u2019s biggest companies</strong>, relieving you of the stress of picking individual stocks since nobody can predict the best stocks.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Automate Your Savings and Investments</h2>\n<p>Finally, automate both habits one and two so that you never have to think about either of these things ever again. Forget about this account and don't touch it for <strong>30 years</strong> because compound interest takes about a decade to really start kicking in. When it does, remember: there\u2019s a reason Einstein called compound interest, <em>the eighth wonder of the world</em>.</p>",
