  "content": "<h1>How to Get Your First $100,000 So Quickly It Feels Like a Scam</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Commit to Your 401k</h2>\n<p>Start by putting <strong>10%</strong> of your paycheck into your <strong>401k</strong>. Go to HR and ask them to automate paycheck deductions so you never have to see what you're missing and learn to live on less.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Pay Off High-Interest Debt</h2>\n<p>Pay off high-interest debt immediately. No matter how much money you're making on your investments, it’s not as much as you’re losing on high-interest credit card debt. Before you play offense, you’ve got to learn to play defense.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Open a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> through Fidelity or Vanguard. Automate contributions of <strong>$50</strong> a week and invest that money in low-cost index funds like VOO or SPY.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Invest in Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Invest <strong>$100</strong> immediately in the following books: <em>Housel's Psychology of Money</em>, <em>Collins' The Simple Path to Wealth</em>, and <em>Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street</em>. Yes, you have to spend money to make money, and this is the quickest way to do it.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Follow those four steps, and you'll be at your first <strong>$100,000</strong> before you know it! If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you another actionable money playbook that actually works.</p>",
