  "content": "<h1>Lessons Learned from Trying to Time the Market in My Early 20s</h1>\n<p>I once tried to time the market in my early 20s, and here’s what I learned.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Selling at the Wrong Time</h2>\n<p>It was <strong>2008</strong>, and yep, I sold right before the bottom, thinking I was being smart. Turns out, I was just being scared.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Missing the Recovery</h2>\n<p>The market recovered in a couple of months, and I waited over a year to try to find the right time to get back in, which meant I missed <strong>20%</strong> of the rebound.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Feelings vs. Logic</h2>\n<p>Timing felt logical, but my feelings sure weren’t. When feelings run the plan, the plan doesn’t run. That was the last year I tried to outsmart the market.</p>\n\n<h2>4. The New Approach</h2>\n<p>Now, I simply outlast the market, and I’ve made more money than I ever did by trying to time it.
