I can take out as much as I want whenever I want after I retire, <strong>100% tax-free</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, but you better start taking those <strong>RMDs</strong> after <strong>72</strong> so you won't get any more tax breaks.</p>\n<p>Oh no, it\u2019s a Roth IRA. I don\u2019t ever have to take RMDs. That\u2019s why I'm actually saving this account for my kids after I die. Then it will be worth closer to <strong>$14 million</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, but we\u2019ll be waiting to tax that money when your kids take it out.</p>\n<p>Now you\u2019re really gonna be upset. Because it\u2019s a Roth, as long as they take distributions over <strong>10 years</strong>, it\u2019s also usually <strong>tax-free</strong>.</p>\n<p>So we get...?</p>\n<p>That\u2019s right, nothing.</p>",
