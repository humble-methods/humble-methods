  "content": "<h1>3 Essential Financial Tips for College Students</h1>\n<p>Here are three quick financial tips for college students:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Never Bring Your Credit Card to a Bar</h2>\n<p>As you drink more, you lose sight of what you're spending and often end up spending way more than you thought. Instead, decide beforehand exactly how much cash you want to spend and bring that amount with you. When it\u2019s gone, you\u2019re done. Your body (and your bank account) will thank you.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Find a Job That Allows You to Study</h2>\n<p>Look for a job on campus that lets you do your studies while working. I worked in a computer center during college where <strong>10%</strong> of my time was helping people save their files before a crash, <strong>10%</strong> was showing them how to print, and the remaining <strong>80%</strong> was spent getting paid to study.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Do Not Buy New Anything</h2>\n<p>This applies to clothes, textbooks, and cars. College is the one time in life when no one cares if you wear a track suit to campus every single day of the week. In fact, you\u2019re often considered cooler if you do. Save your money for experiences, not material goods.</p>\n\n<p>If you find these tips helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll continue sharing advice to help you manage your finances!</p>",
