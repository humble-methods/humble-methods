  "content": "<h1>The Biggest Investing Lie You've Ever Been Told</h1>\n<p>Tyler, you know the rest. The biggest lie is that you aren't smart enough to invest money on your own. So let's see if you are by taking a quick quiz.</p>\n<h2>Quiz Time</h2>\n<h3>1. Short-term Goals</h3>\n<p>Do you know how much money you need right now or in the near future to accomplish your short-term goals? I thought so. That money goes to a high-yield savings account or a money market fund where your money is safe but still can earn 10 times the national average on a traditional savings account.</p>\n<h3>2. Long-term Goals</h3>\n<p>Now, do you know how much you can afford to set aside for your long-term goals? Great! Now you can open a Roth IRA or a taxable brokerage; fund those accounts with that money and invest it in a low-cost index fund or ETF.</p>\n<h3>3. The Simple Truth</h3>\n<p>If someone ever tells you it needs to be more complicated than that, odds are they're selling you something that will take away money from both your short-term and long-term goals and fund their short-term and long-term goals.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter in my bio and every Sunday morning, I'll send over some thoughts to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
