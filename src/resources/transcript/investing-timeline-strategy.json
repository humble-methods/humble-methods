  "content": "<h1>The Only Investing Video You Will Ever Need</h1>\n<p>If anyone tells you otherwise, they're trying to sell you something. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Money Needed in 0 to 2 Years</h2>\n<p>If you need the money in zero to two years, it should be held entirely in cash, bonds, or CDs through a fund like SPAXX or BND. You cannot afford a market crash right before you actually need the money.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Money Needed in 2 to 7 Years</h2>\n<p>If you need your money in two to seven years, start at <strong>50%</strong> stocks, <strong>50%</strong> bonds through VOO and BND, and shift toward all cash or bonds as you get closer to two years. This strategy allows some mid-term growth while still maintaining relative stability.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Money Needed in 7+ Years</h2>\n<p>Finally, if you don't need the cash for seven or more years, go all stocks via VTI or VUG. Then start shifting back to options one and two around year seven. Remember, being 65 doesn't mean you need your money tomorrow, and being 25 doesn't mean you don't need it until retirement. Every dollar has its own timeline, so always invest based on when you need it, not how old you are.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
