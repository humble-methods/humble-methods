  "content": "<p>Here is the quickest way to turn <strong>$75</strong> into a <strong>million bucks</strong>.</p> \n<p>I'm <strong>Tyler</strong>, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p> \n<h2>Step 1: Buy Jack Bogle's Book on Mutual Funds</h2> \n<p>There is no single person who has influenced my life more than <strong>Jack Bogle</strong>, and I owe my 20 years of investing success entirely to his guidance.</p> \n<h2>Step 2: Read Jeremy Siegel's The Future for Investors</h2> \n<p>Siegel is one of those timeless greats who will tell you exactly what's real and what is nonsense. This is a must-read for those of us who didn't have the privilege of working with him at <strong>Wharton</strong>.</p> \n<h2>Step 3: Get Morgan Housel's The Psychology of Money</h2> \n<p>This book is fun, it's a page-turner, and it reminds us that we're not alone when we let our emotions get the best of us, leading to some pretty stupid investing decisions.</p> \n<p>And if any of this is helpful, don't forget to like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
