Now I make financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Know When and Why You're Taking Social Security</h2>\n<p>The break-even point is usually around <strong>78 to 80 years old</strong>. If you take it early at <strong>62</strong>, you get less per month but more years. Wait until <strong>70</strong>, and you’ll receive more each month but for fewer years. Decide what actually fits your life expectancy and projected cash flow needs.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Know Your Projected Annual Expenses</h2>\n<p>Multiply that number by <strong>1.2</strong> for taxes and margin of error, then multiply that result by <strong>20</strong>, because a <strong>5%</strong> withdrawal rate is usually what keeps your principal intact.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Simplify Your Portfolio</h2>\n<p>And I cannot stress this one enough: simplify your dang portfolio. Risk on equals stocks; risk off equals money markets. You don’t need <strong>20 funds</strong> and <strong>15 real estate deals</strong> because your primary residence already gives you plenty of real estate exposure.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works each week.</p>",
