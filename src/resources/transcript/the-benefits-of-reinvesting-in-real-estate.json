Because I'll be reinvesting that money into a nicer property in a fancier neighborhood.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t owe you a dime.</p>\n\n<p>Hmm? Five years later...</p>\n<p>Hey Dad, did you sell the new property and make <strong>$400,000</strong> in gains?</p>\n<p>Yes, I did.</p>\n<p>Okay, now I'll take my taxes on even more of your income.</p>\n<p>Not so fast. I'm just putting it back into another property in the wealthiest neighborhood I know.</p>\n<p>Okay, but this time you better let us know when you stop reinvesting. We'll be waiting.</p>\n<p>We'll be waiting a long time. I'm not selling this property. I'm leaving it to my son, and all of the capital gains will reset and disappear. No taxes for you.</p>\n<p>Aww. Didn't you write the tax code?</p>\n<p>Oh, I just started yesterday. Great benefits.</p>",
