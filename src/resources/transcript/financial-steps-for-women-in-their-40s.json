  "content": "<h1>Five Financial Steps for Women in Their 40s</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Open a brokerage account today with Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard. Women start investing five years later than men on average, costing over a quarter of a million bucks in compound interest alone. If you invest $500 a month in VOO from 40 to 65, you'll likely have around <strong>$650,000</strong>. But if you wait until 45, you'll only have about <strong>$420,000</strong>. See the difference five years can make?</p>\n\n<h2>2. Save and Invest 15% of Each Paycheck</h2>\n<p>Men are told to save 10%, but women live six years longer and earn 16% less on average. You need to save more as your lifetime earnings are statistically lower.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Negotiate Your Salary</h2>\n<p>You'll never have more leverage than when you're offered a job. Negotiating your salary is crucial. A $5,000 raise at 40 doesn't just add $5,000 a year. Invested at 10% growth, that's an additional <strong>$280,000</strong> by age 65.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Move Your Cash</h2>\n<p>If your cash is sitting in a traditional savings account, move it today. 62% of women have cash earning less than 0.6% per year, while inflation runs at 3% per year, losing 2.4% of purchasing power annually. Transfer it to a high-yield savings account or a money market fund like Fidelity's SPAXX to protect your purchasing power.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Start Investing Today</h2>\n<p>You're better investors on average than men, yet only 58% of women are invested in the stock market versus 66% of men. Fix that with $500 a month into a brokerage account, focusing on a low-cost index fund. If you can't do $500, do less; remember, doing less is always better than doing nothing.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
