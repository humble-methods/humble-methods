  "content": "<h1>Tax Efficient Investing Strategy</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Here's exactly where I'd put each of my investments to be as tax efficient as possible:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Tax-Deferred Accounts</h2>\n<p>In my tax-deferred accounts, like a traditional 401k, 403b, or IRA, I'd put my tax inefficient stuff, like bonds and REITs. Why? These investments constantly throw off income and dividends that can be taxed as ordinary income, up to 37%. Therefore, funds like Vanguard's <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VNQ\">BND</a> or <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VNQ\">VNQ</a> belong in tax-advantaged accounts, allowing them to compound without the IRS taking a cut every single year.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Tax-Free Accounts</h2>\n<p>In my tax-free accounts, like a Roth 401k or Roth IRA, I'd allocate my highest growth, most volatile investments. If those investments 10x, all returns are tax-free. If they crash, psychologically, I likely won't sell because it’s in a retirement account. Funds like Vanguard's <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/small-cap-value/profile\">VSIAX</a>, a small cap value index fund, or <a href=\"https://www.invesco.com/us/products/qqqm\">QQQM</a>, which tracks Nasdaq Tech, will go in this category where we shoot for significant growth.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Taxable Brokerage Accounts</h2>\n<p>Finally, in my taxable brokerage account, I’d put my tax-efficient investments, like total market or S&P index funds. These funds barely throw off dividends, and I can control when I sell. Examples would include <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VTI\">VTI</a> or <a href=\"https://investor.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/overview/FXAIX\">FXAIX</a>. When I do sell, I pay long-term capital gains rates if I've held the investment for over a year, and that 15% or 20% tax rate sure beats 37% taxation.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>By placing the right funds in the right accounts, I can potentially save tens of thousands of dollars over my lifetime.
