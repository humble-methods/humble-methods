  "content": "<p>Hey dad, could you tell me something that seems illegal but isn't?</p> <p>Absolutely. Each year I pay less in taxes than most teachers and nurses do, even though I make about a hundred times as much.</p> <p>Is this just some tax loophole for the rich? Absolutely. Because I work in private equity, each year I claim $10 million of my income as investment income.</p> <p>What's the catch? My compensation just needs to be taken out of the investments I manage for others. Then it is considered carried interest and is taxed at a much lower rate.</p> <p>So instead of paying 37% on your millions of profits, you pay 20%.</p> <p>But aren't you supposed to be helping others get rich? Yup. And as they get richer, so do I.</p> <p>Ah, the circle of wealth. Well, it's really more like a straight line, but I hear you.</p>",
