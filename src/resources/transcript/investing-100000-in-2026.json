  "content": "<h1>Here's Exactly How I'd Invest $100,000 in 2026</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Start with the S&P 500</h2>\n<p>Start by putting $65,000 in an S&P 500 fund like Vanguard's VOO or Fidelity's FXAIX. That's my foundation, owning 500 of the most consistently profitable companies in the world from Microsoft to McDonald's. And even in recessions, we're still going to eat our double quarter pounders with cheese.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Diversify Internationally</h2>\n<p>Then I'd put $15,000 into a total international index fund like Vanguard's VXUS or Schwab's SCHF. 2025 reminded us that US stocks don't always win the year. So own the rest of the world and stop pretending you can predict the next outperformer.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in Dividend ETFs</h2>\n<p>Next, I'd put $10,000 into a dividend ETF like VIG or DGRO, focusing on companies that not only make money but actually share it with you. I would just make sure to keep this in a retirement account so I'm not donating a portion of it to the IRS every April.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Hold in a Money Market Fund</h2>\n<p>Finally, I'd hold $10,000 in a money market fund like Fidelity's SPAXX or Schwab's SNVXX. These are earning around 4% to 5%, giving me flexibility if an opportunity presents itself or I need some quick liquidity.</p>\n\n<p>And that's it. I've just built a globally diversified, tax-efficient, low-cost portfolio that historically beats over 90% of professional fund managers worldwide net fees, all for the low cost of about 40 bucks a year.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter, and each week I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
