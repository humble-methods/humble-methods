  "content": "<h1>The Only Strategy You Need to Manage Your Own Portfolio</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Core Investment Strategy</h2>\n<p>Invest <strong>90%</strong> in an S&P fund like Vanguard's VOO or a total stock fund like VTI. Invest the remaining <strong>10%</strong> in a money market like S-GOV or SPAXX. That's it—no complexity, no private equity, and certainly no paying a financial advisor 1% of your money for everyday advice.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Adjusting for Risk</h2>\n<p>If <strong>90%</strong> in stocks makes you nervous, go <strong>70%</strong> stocks, <strong>20%</strong> in BND (Vanguard's aggregate bond fund), and <strong>10%</strong> in a money market.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest Based on Timeline</h2>\n<p>Forget age-based allocation rules. Instead, invest your money based on when you need it. If you need it in two years, be heavier on the money market and bonds. If you need it in 20 years, focus heavier on stocks. Your timeline matters; your birthday does not.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Buffer Strategy</h2>\n<p>In down years, draw from the money market to avoid selling stocks at a loss. In up years, gradually replenish the money market by selling stocks once they've recovered. This approach keeps it simple with just two to three funds, one strategy based on your timing, and zero overthinking.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
