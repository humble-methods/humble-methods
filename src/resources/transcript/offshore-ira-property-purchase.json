Each year I use about 50% of my IRA to purchase property in the Bahamas.</p>\n<p>I don't think you're allowed to do that.</p>\n<p>You can if you have an offshore IRA.</p>\n<p>What's the catch? I form an offshore company and that company is owned by my offshore IRA.</p>\n<p>How can an IRA own a company? Well, your IRA can hold companies like Amazon and Apple, right? Yeah, an offshore IRA can hold companies too, like the one that I just formed.</p>\n<p>We then use that company to open offshore accounts and then we use those offshore accounts to purchase, well, just about anything we want.</p>\n<p>That sounds incredibly sketchy.</p>\n<p>Oh, it is. I don't recommend you're ever doing anything with your money unless you understand every single aspect of it. Rule one, always.</p>",
