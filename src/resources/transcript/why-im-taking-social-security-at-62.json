  "content": "<h1>Why I’ll Be Taking My Social Security at 62</h1>\n<p>Here’s exactly why I’ll be taking my Social Security at 62 years old. And no, it has nothing to do with Donald Trump or politics. I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I spend most of my time working on a new podcast, so if any of this is helpful, check it out by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. More Overall Money</h2>\n<p>By taking my Social Security at <strong>62</strong>, according to my newly created account on <strong>ssa.gov</strong>, I’d receive about <strong>$2,200</strong> a month. If I waited until <strong>70</strong>, I’d get closer to <strong>$3,200</strong> a month. The mistake is thinking in these monthly terms. By taking it at <strong>62</strong>, I will have more overall money for the next <strong>19 years</strong> of my life.</p>\n\n<h2>2. More Time to Enjoy Life</h2>\n<p>By taking my Social Security at <strong>62</strong>, that means <strong>19 more years</strong> with more money, more health, more mobility, and more mental clarity to spend the money. I want to use it to buy back a much greater asset: <strong>time</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Avoiding Crazy Land</h2>\n<p>I refuse to spend the rest of my life being told that once I get to the promised land, I now have another <strong>19 years</strong> to wait before reaching the real promised land. That’s just crazy land! For those who disagree with me, I have one question: at what age am I finally allowed to spend my money and enjoy my life?</p>",
