  "content": "<h1>Top 5 Reasons I'm Taking My Social Security at 62</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Here are the top five reasons I'm taking my social security at 62:</p>\n\n<h2>1. More Money Overall Until Age 80</h2>\n<p>If I take it at 62 instead of waiting until 70, I'll have more money overall until I'm 80 years old. You can calculate your own break-even point by visiting <a href=\"https://ssa.gov\" target=\"_blank\">ssa.gov</a> and adding up the numbers yourself.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Benefit from Compound Interest</h2>\n<p>If I take it at 62 and invest the money, I'll have more money overall forever, as that money will now have eight additional years to compound and grow. </p>\n\n<h2>3. Earnings Consideration</h2>\n<p>If I take it at 62 and choose to keep working, sure, I could get docked $1 for every $2 I earn over $23,400 in 2025. But here's the kicker: Let's say I don't end up working. In the case that I do work, that docked money isn't gone forever. It gets recalculated back into the benefits once I reach full retirement age.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Health Insurance Planning</h2>\n<p>Taking it at 62 means I won't be working at that point. So what about health insurance? Well, that's why I’m investing $100 a week right now in a taxable brokerage account, specifically to cover future health and well-being costs.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Enjoy Life Now</h2>\n<p>And the biggest reason of all: If I take it at 62 instead of waiting until 70, I’ll have eight more years to actually enjoy this money. Why continue deferring a life that everyone tells me to wait for? I might never meet the future version of myself that’s supposed to exist. In contrast to those kids in the Stanford marshmallow experiment, I don’t wish to keep postponing life for the chance at future rewards. After all, what good is a marshmallow if I'm not around to enjoy it?</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please join my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
