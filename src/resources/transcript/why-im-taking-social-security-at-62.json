  "content": "<h1>Why I’m Taking My Social Security at 62</h1>\n<p>As a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, here are three reasons I’ll be taking my Social Security at 62. And if you think I’m just a rambling ding-dong who’s been in the woods of Vermont for too long, well, you’re probably right. But hear me out.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Value of Experience Over Money</h2>\n<p>The check may be smaller at 62, but it’s worth more because I’m no longer interested in just money. I’m now focused on spending on experiences and creating meaningful, lasting memories as deliberately as I can. By creating these memories earlier, I have <strong>10 to 20 years</strong> more to compound.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Overall Financial Benefit</h2>\n<p>The check may be smaller at 62, but I get it <strong>eight years earlier</strong> than if I waited until 70. I’ll also have more money overall until I’m <strong>81 years old</strong>. What child ever turned to their parents and said, “You know what, mom? My dream is to have <strong>$500</strong> more a month in my 80s?”</p>\n\n<h2>3. Enjoying the Present</h2>\n<p>The check may be smaller at 62, but as Garrison Keillor points out, you get old and realize there are no answers, just stories. The story I’d like to tell is about finally enjoying life and letting go of this endless quest to optimize and defer it for some distant vision of something that, for most of us, may never truly come to fruition. Nobody likes that story very much.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So just remember, it’s not about the size of the check; it’s how we use it.</p>",
