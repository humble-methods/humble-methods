  "content": "<h1>3 Reasons I’m Taking My Social Security at 62</h1>\n<p>As a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, here’s why I’m choosing to take Social Security at 62. And spoiler alert, it has nothing to do with money. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Math Only Works if You're Alive to Collect It</h2>\n<p>You don't get a gold star for continuing to defer joy. The perfect claiming age is a mirage. Just ask the people who never make it to <strong>80</strong>, or worse, those who do but can't enjoy <strong>$1</strong> of their additional monthly benefits.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Memories Compound Faster Than Money</h2>\n<p>I'd rather spend my <strong>60s</strong> walking foreign streets, eating like a king, and laughing with the people I love. Delaying gratification is fine, but delay it too long, and you might not get it at all.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Current Script is Broken</h2>\n<p>We were told, work, save, and then someday, you'll be rewarded. Now the system says, but wait, there's more! Now you should optimize for your <strong>80s</strong>. So I’ll take that check at <strong>62</strong>, not because it's the optimized number, but because I don't want to miss the most important years of my life trying to maximize a number I might never get to see.</p>",
