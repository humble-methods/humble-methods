  "content": "<p>Tyler? Yep. Says here you made a <strong>$1 salary</strong> this year? Yep.</p> <p>That can't be right. You're the <strong>CEO of one of the biggest firms in America</strong>. I know for a fact you received <strong>$500,000 of compensation</strong>. That is correct.</p> <p>Okay, this is <strong>tax evasion</strong>, Tyler. No, it's <strong>tax education</strong>. See, I don't have what people would call a normal income. Otherwise, I'd owe <strong>35% in taxes</strong>.</p> <p>Yikes! So how do you plan on getting all that money? I get paid with <strong>stock options</strong>. That way, when the company crushes it, and we will crush it, I'll eventually sell the company and the stock, and I'll get all that money back in the form of <strong>capital gains</strong>. Those are taxed at <strong>20%</strong>.</p>",
