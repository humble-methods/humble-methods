  "content": "<h1>Top Three Things to Consider When Choosing a Financial Planner</h1>\n<p>If I needed a financial planner, here are the top three things I would look for.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content with companies like Facet to show you what the future of financial planning looks like.</p>\n<h2>1. Fee Structure</h2>\n<p>Number one, are they charging me for advice, not the size of my assets? Flat annual fees keep the focus on your goals, not their paychecks.</p>\n<h2>2. Honesty About Market Performance</h2>\n<p>Number two, are they honest with me? If they tell you they can beat the market, <strong>A</strong>, that's irrelevant because past returns are never indicative of future results, and <strong>B</strong>, over the long haul, no, they can't, and no, they won't. You want a team that will focus on low cost, expert investment allocation, and who will offer guidance with holistic tax strategy and estate planning.</p>\n<h2>3. Integrity in Their Approach</h2>\n<p>Number three, are they honest with themselves? If they are charging you based on a percentage of your assets or trying to sell you products that you likely don't need, who's really being served? Not my style.</p>\n<p>So if you're looking for the team that checks all of these boxes, go to <a href=\"https://facet.com/tyler\">facet.com/tyler</a> today to meet with our team of certified financial planner professionals who will help get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
