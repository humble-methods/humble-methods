  "content": "<h1>The 401k Match is Overhyped: Here’s Why</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. It’s Free Money, but Not a Magic Button</h2>\n<p>Yes, the match is essentially free money. However, people treat it like a magic button, assuming that simply hitting that <strong>6%</strong> match means they’re done. Spoiler: that's not going to fund your retirement unless you're planning on living off of lentils.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Expensive and Outdated Investment Options</h2>\n<p>Most <strong>401k</strong> plans are full of expensive and outdated mutual funds. If you're paying <strong>1% or 2%</strong> in fees, that free money comes with a very expensive string attached.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Lack of Liquidity and Control</h2>\n<p>There’s no liquidity, not as much control, and no access to your funds until age <strong>59 ½</strong>. To be clear, I'm not telling you to skip it. Just don’t act like it’s the finish line. A <strong>401k</strong> is a tool, not a trophy.</h2>\n\n<h2>4. Focus on Building Real Wealth</h2>\n<p>Max the match, but don't let it distract you from building real wealth on your own terms as well.</p>",
