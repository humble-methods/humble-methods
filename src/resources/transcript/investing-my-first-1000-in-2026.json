  "content": "<h1>How I'd Invest My First $1,000 in 2026</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. $400 into Vanguard's VTI</h2>\n<p>This gives you instant ownership of thousands of US companies—from Apple to Amazon to the ones still hustling to build the next great thing out of their friend's garage in rural Wisconsin.</p>\n\n<h2>2. $250 into an International Fund</h2>\n<p>Investing in funds like VXUS or IXUS reminds us that the US doesn't always win the performance race. Diversification isn’t just a fancy word; it's how you keep your assets growing regardless of who's winning.</p>\n\n<h2>3. $200 into a Tech Tilted Fund</h2>\n<p>Add a little extra growth with QQQM or VGT. This includes companies inventing the future, like Nvidia and Broadcom, along with the rest of Silicon Valley's caffeine-powered geniuses.</p>\n\n<h2>4. $100 into a Dividend ETF</h2>\n<p>Consider funds like VIG or DGRO, but only if it's in a tax-deferred account. Otherwise, don’t volunteer to pay taxes on income that you don’t need and don’t use.</p>\n\n<h2>5. $50 into a Single Stock</h2>\n<p>Pick one or two stocks of your choice. After all, as every true Vermonter knows, if it's not fun, why do it? Getting your first 10X stock in life is pretty dang fun!</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my <strong>free weekly newsletter</strong> by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
