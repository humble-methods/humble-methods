  "content": "<h1>Top 5 Things to Do with Your Money Right Now</h1>\n<p>Here are the top five things that I would do with my money right now as a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I'm Tyler, and I create financial content for free to help guide your financial decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Contribute to Retirement and Health Accounts</h2>\n<p>I would march directly to HR and ask them to put a percentage of my paycheck towards my <strong>401(k)</strong>, <strong>Roth IRA</strong>, and <strong>HSA</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Maximize Employer Matches</h2>\n<p>I would ensure that this percentage is high enough to take advantage of every single penny my company might offer as a match on my <strong>401(k)</strong> or <strong>HSA</strong>. Yup, companies match funding for HSAs now!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in Low-Cost Index Funds</h2>\n<p>Within each of these accounts, I would invest in <strong>low-cost index funds</strong> because I know I cannot beat the market on an annual basis, and if you can, super duper! And yes, you can invest in your <strong>health savings account</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Obtain Term Life Insurance</h2>\n<p>If I needed insurance\u2014meaning if I had someone in my life who relied solely on my income for their well-being\u2014I would buy a reasonably priced <strong>term life policy</strong>. I would also ensure that this person is listed as a beneficiary on my retirement account.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Spend on What Brings You Joy</h2>\n<p>Finally, I would choose the three things in life that bring me the most <strong>joy</strong> and <strong>peace of mind</strong> when spending money. I would commit to never skimping on those three things. For me, that's my <strong>mental health</strong>, <strong>physical health</strong>, and my <strong>bloodhounds</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
