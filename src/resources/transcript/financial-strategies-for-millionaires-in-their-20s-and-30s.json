Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Open up a Roth IRA through Fidelity and fund that account with <strong>20 to 25 dollars a week</strong>. Don\u2019t worry, if you ever need that money back, you can take back the contributions at any time, penalty and tax-free.</p>\n<h2>2. Invest Aggressively</h2>\n<p>Invest that 20 to 25 dollars into a more aggressive fund than one that tracks the S&P 500, such as Invesco's QQQ. This is a much more volatile but aggressive fund that tracks the 100 non-financial companies in the NASDAQ composite. It has returned over <strong>14% annually</strong> for the last 30 years, compared to the S&P's 10%. This strategy can potentially yield a difference of almost <strong>$2 million</strong> over 30 years, even through significant downturns such as the housing crisis of 2008 and the global pandemic of 2020.</p>\n<h2>3. Tax-Free Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>Because you chose to invest in a Roth IRA instead of a brokerage account, every single penny of that <strong>$2.5 million</strong> is 100% tax-free after 59 and a half. Take the rest of the afternoon off and treat yourself to a celebratory beverage, because you've just set yourself on the path to potential wealth!</p>",
