  "content": "<h1>How to Transform $1,000 into $100,000 on an $83,000 Salary</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Start by putting $1,000 in a Roth IRA and investing it in a low-cost growth fund like Vanguard's <strong>VUG</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Contribute to Your 401(k)</h2>\n<p>Now contribute enough to the 401(k) to get your 6% match, bringing your total investment to <strong>$10,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Increase Your Roth Contributions</h2>\n<p>Add another $150 a month to the Roth IRA, and at the end of year one, expect a total of <strong>$13,600</strong> with a projected <strong>7%</strong> real return.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Stay Consistent</h2>\n<p>Continue the same contributions through year two. Your year two ending balance should be around <strong>$27,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Adjust for Raises</h2>\n<p>In year three, say you get a <strong>4%</strong> raise at work. Increase your 401(k) contributions to <strong>10%</strong> and max out your Roth at <strong>$7,500</strong> starting in 2026. Your year three ending balance should be approximately <strong>$51,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Final Steps Toward $100,000</h2>\n<p>In year four, stay the course and assume another raise in year five. Increase your 401(k) contributions to <strong>12%</strong> while continuing to max out the Roth. Your year five ending balance will be about <strong>$110,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Five years, five steps, one US median household income.
