  "content": "<h1>Three Things to Fix Before Retirement for True Happiness</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Retire to Something, Not From Something</h2>\n<p>I get it, you want to escape from work, but what’s next? If you don’t have a plan, guess what? Pretty soon, you’re gonna want to escape from the emptiness of not having a plan.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Learn How to Spend Your Money Now</h2>\n<p>This might sound odd, but for decades, you’ve been praised for saving and accumulating. It’s what you’ve been taught to do. Most retirees die with way more money in their accounts than when they retired, as they never gave themselves permission to spend.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Understand Wealth Beyond Money and Time</h2>\n<p>More money or more time doesn’t necessarily mean more happiness. Real wealth is not just about money and it’s not just about time; it’s knowing what to do with either so that it leaves you happy and fulfilled from one day to the next.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week, I’ll send you another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
