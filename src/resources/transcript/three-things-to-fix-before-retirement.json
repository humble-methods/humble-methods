  "content": "<h1>Three Things to Fix Before Retirement</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Retire to Something, Not From Something</h2>\n<p>A study from the Institute of Economic Affairs found that retirement increases your chances of clinical depression by <strong>40%</strong> and your likelihood of being diagnosed with a physical condition by <strong>60%</strong>. Why? Because most people retire from work, not to something else. If you don't have a plan to fill those days, just know you're going to want to escape that emptiness very quickly.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Learn How to Spend Your Money Now</h2>\n<p>This may sound odd coming from a personal finance channel, but research from Texas Tech found that retirees die with an average of <strong>80%</strong> of their pre-retirement savings intact. We've spent our entire lives being praised for saving, and we've never quite given ourselves enough permission to spend. Start training that deliberate spending muscle now and go buy an experience that makes you and your family happy.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Understand That More Money or Time Doesn't Mean More Happiness</h2>\n<p>A Princeton study once found that happiness plateaus around <strong>$75,000</strong>. Today, it would be more like <strong>$150,000</strong>. But after that, more money doesn't move the needle. Real wealth isn't money and it isn't even time. It's learning what to do with either that leaves you fulfilled each day.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
