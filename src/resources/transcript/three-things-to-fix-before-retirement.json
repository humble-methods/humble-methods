  "content": "<h1>3 Things You Must Fix Before Retirement for True Happiness</h1>\n<p>If you don't fix these three things before retirement, I promise no amount of money is going to make you happy. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I spend <strong>99%</strong> of my time working on a new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>. Check it out by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Retire to Something, Not From Something</h2>\n<p>You need to retire <strong>to something</strong> rather than <strong>from something</strong>. Like most people, you've probably spent most of your life wanting to escape from work. But do you know what's next? After the initial excitement of retirement, you’ll likely face identity issues. Starting today, plan what you’re retiring to.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Learn How to Spend Money</h2>\n<p>Learning how to actually <strong>spend money</strong> is crucial. For <strong>40 years</strong>, you’ve gotten great at saving and accumulating, but flipping that switch can often be terrifying. Many retirees continue to hoard money and end up dying with far more than they started with. The fix? Create an <strong>annual emergency spending account</strong>. This fund is use-it-or-lose-it; it encourages you to spend on experiences and enjoyment.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Value of Time Over Money</h2>\n<p>Finally, understand that time is far more valuable than money. In your working years, money and status felt like the things to achieve. In retirement, time becomes incredibly precious, and no amount of money is going to buy it back, no matter how much Gatsby wanted us to believe it would. The happiest retirees maximize <strong>experience</strong>, <strong>relationships</strong>, and <strong>health</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this resonates with you, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. I’ll send over insights like this every Sunday morning to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
