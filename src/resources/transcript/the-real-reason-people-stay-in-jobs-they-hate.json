  "content": "<h1>The Real Reason People Stay in Jobs They Hate</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Tying Identity to Work</h2>\n<p>We often tie our identity to our work. Quitting a toxic job doesn't feel like merely changing roles; it feels like erasing a piece of who we are.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Fear of Failure</h2>\n<p>Most people do not fear going broke; they fear looking like they failed. This fear keeps them stuck, seeking applause they don’t even want anymore.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Cost vs. Salary</h2>\n<p>The job might pay well, but consider the cost: your energy, relationships, and time. That’s not a paycheck—that’s a trade-off. If your job is costing you your life, it’s too expensive, no matter what the salary.</p>",
