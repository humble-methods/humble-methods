  "content": "<h1>How to Calculate Your Coast Fire Number for Early Retirement</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Determine Your Annual Spending</h2>\n<p>Take your annual spending, not income, spending, and multiply it by 20. This calculation assumes you can safely spend 5% of your principal investment annually and not run out of money. For example, if you spend <strong>$60,000 a year</strong>, your Coast Fire number is approximately <strong>$1.2 million</strong> in retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Decide When You Want to Retire</h2>\n<p>Pick the age by which you want to retire. For instance, let’s consider you want to retire by <strong>55</strong>, and you are currently <strong>30</strong>, giving you a 25-year time horizon.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Project Your Investment Return</h2>\n<p>Next, choose your projected interest rate based on your investment strategy. If you're invested entirely in stocks, you can assume a <strong>7%</strong> return. If you have a mixed portfolio of <strong>50%</strong> stocks and <strong>50%</strong> bonds, use a <strong>5%</strong> return.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Calculate Your Required Starting Amount</h2>\n<p>Now, take your retirement goal (in this case, $1.2 million) and divide it by <strong>1.07</strong> raised to the power of <strong>25</strong>. This determines how much you need today to reach your goal. Using our example, <strong>$1,200,000 / (1.07 ^ 25) = $221,000</strong>. So, if you hit that number today, you will never have to contribute to your retirement accounts again and you’ll most likely have $1.2 million by age 55.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Spend Your Savings Now</h2>\n<p>Take the money that you would normally save for retirement and use it on travel, experiences, or simply buying back your time for present-you. This approach prevents overfunding future-you’s lifestyle.</p>\n\n<p>And if any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
