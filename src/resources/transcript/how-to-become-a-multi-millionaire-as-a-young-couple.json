  "content": "<h1>How to Become a Multi-Millionaire</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how I would become a multi-millionaire if I were a 35-year-old married couple. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Financial Strategy Overview</h2>\n<ol>\n    <li><strong>Annual Income:</strong> Let's assume we make <strong>$200,000</strong> a year annually, combined pre-tax.</li>\n    <li><strong>Post-Tax Income:</strong> After federal, state, and payroll taxes, let's assume that's about <strong>$150,000</strong> post-tax.</li>\n    <li><strong>Retirement Investment:</strong> We will each invest <strong>$23,000</strong> in Roth 401(k)s into low-cost index funds.</li>\n    <li><strong>Disposable Income:</strong> This leaves us with just over <strong>$100,000</strong> of disposable income. Tight, but doable.</li>\n    <li><strong>Projected Balance:</strong> By age <strong>65</strong>, we would have a projected balance of <strong>$4.34 million</strong> in the Roth 401(k)s.</li>\n    <li><strong>Annual Withdrawals:</strong> We can then draw down <strong>6%</strong> per year, yielding <strong>$260,580</strong> of tax-free income.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Not bad for a couple who wasn't making that much money annually to begin with.</p>",
