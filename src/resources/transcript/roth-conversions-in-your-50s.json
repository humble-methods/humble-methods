  "content": "<h1>How to Optimize Roth Conversions in Your 50s</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>The Roth Conversion Strategy</h2>\n<p>Here is exactly how I would think about Roth conversions in my 50s.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Your Tax Sweet Spot</h3>\n<p>Your 50s and early 60s are your tax sweet spot. Usually post-peak earning years, but pre-social security, pensions, and required minimum distributions (RMDs). Many find themselves in a lower tax bracket than in their 40s.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Evaluate Your Assets</h3>\n<p>Most of our assets, statistically speaking, are tied up in pre-tax accounts like traditional 401(k)s, 403(b)s, or IRAs.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Utilize Your Tax Bracket</h3>\n<p>For instance, if you're married and make $120,000 in your 50s, you're likely in the 22% marginal tax bracket. This bracket tops out around $211,000 of taxable income in 2026. That gives you about <strong>$90,000</strong> of room to convert without hitting the next tax bracket. You can convert <strong>$90,000</strong> from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA while staying within the 22% bracket. Result? Pay taxes now and let the investments grow tax-free for life.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Make It a Regular Practice</h3>\n<p>This isn't a one-time action. Start the conversion process in your 50s and continue for the next ten years. If you convert enough to fill your current tax bracket without hitting the next, let's say you do that for the next 10 years, that's almost a million dollars moved to a Roth, of which you paid 22% marginal tax.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Is this strategy right for you? Maybe. Consult a CPA, not some ding-dong walking in the woods of Vermont.</p>\n\n<p>For more tips on this topic, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
