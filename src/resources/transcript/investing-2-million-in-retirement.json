  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $2 Million in Retirement and Live Off Six Figures Without Worry</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in a Low-Cost Index Fund</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>100%</strong> of the money in a low-cost index fund like Vanguard’s <strong>VOO</strong>. This would provide me with approximately <strong>$22,800</strong> a year in dividends, while my funds are invested in <strong>500</strong> of the world’s most profitable and stable companies, including <strong>Broadcom</strong>, <strong>Meta</strong>, and <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Monthly Sales of Investments</h2>\n<p>On the second day of each month, I’d sell <strong>0.5%</strong> of my investments. That would give me an additional <strong>$120,000</strong> a year, avoiding a large selling spree at once. On average, markets are higher in a year than they are today.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Receive Social Security Benefits</h2>\n<p>I’d then receive another <strong>$24,000</strong> or so from <strong>Social Security</strong>. You can find out your projections by going to <strong>ssa.gov</strong> today.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Enjoy Life in Sedona</h2>\n<p>Finally, I’d move to <strong>Sedona, Arizona</strong>, and live off of <strong>$130,000</strong> a year post-tax, fully devoting myself to crystal healing. Consider that <strong>94%</strong> of my assets are still in stocks, giving me about a <strong>96%</strong> chance of outliving both my money and my chakras.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works each week.</p>",
