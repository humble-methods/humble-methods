  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $2 Million in Retirement Without Running Out of Money</h1>\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in a Low-Cost ETF</h2>\n<p>Start by investing <strong>$1.8 million</strong> in a low-cost ETF like Vanguard's <strong>VOO</strong>. This is the money I expect to grow at an average of <strong>7%</strong> per year. It’s a low-cost option to own the most stable and profitable companies in the world.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Low-Cost Money Market Fund</h2>\n<p>Invest the remaining <strong>$200,000</strong> in a low-cost money market fund like Fidelity's <strong>FPAXX</strong>. This invests in short-term, relatively safe government securities like <strong>T-bills</strong>, providing me with liquidity and stability.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Draw from the ETF</h2>\n<p>Next, I’d sell <strong>5%</strong> of the VOO per year, providing me with about <strong>$90,000</strong> to start. Pro tip: I wouldn’t do it all at once; I’d sell about <strong>0.4%</strong> per month since <strong>75%</strong> of the time, markets are higher in a year than they are today.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Earnings from the Money Market Fund</h2>\n<p>I’d earn an additional <strong>$8,000</strong> a year from the money market fund.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Dividend Income</h2>\n<p>I’d earn another <strong>$25,000</strong> a year from the current dividend yield on VOO.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Social Security Benefits</h2>\n<p>I’d complement that with my national average Social Security of <strong>$24,000</strong> a year.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Total Annual Income</h2>\n<p>With this setup, I’d be confident that <strong>$147,000</strong> per year would be just enough to fund my daily walks in the woods with my dogs and enjoy coffee on the porch with my friends and family.</p>\n\n<h2>8. Regular Rebalancing</h2>\n<p>Each year, I’d take the <strong>10 minutes</strong> necessary to rebalance the portfolio, so it always reflects the same growth to stability ratio that works for me.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
