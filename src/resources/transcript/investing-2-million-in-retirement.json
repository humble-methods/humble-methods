  "content": "<h1>How I'd Invest $2,000,000 in Retirement to Never Run Out of Money</h1>\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. $600,000 in SCHD</h2>\n<p>This is <strong>Schwab's dividend ETF</strong>, which features companies that raise dividends every year like clockwork. The current yield is about <strong>3.5%</strong>, translating to <strong>$21,000</strong> a year in dividends from owning stable companies.</p>\n\n<h2>2. $400,000 in VNQ</h2>\n<p>This is <strong>Vanguard's real estate ETF</strong>. REITs are required by law to pay out 90% of their income as dividends, so you get consistent dividends without any tenant hassles. The current yield is around <strong>4%</strong>, adding another <strong>$16,000</strong> a year.</p>\n\n<h2>3. $500,000 in BND</h2>\n<p>This is <strong>Vanguard's total bond fund</strong>. It’s like chamomile tea in ETF form—calming, but not my personal favorite. The yield is approximately <strong>4.5%</strong>, generating <strong>$22,500</strong> annually.</p>\n\n<h2>4. $300,000 in VTIP</h2>\n<p>This represents <strong>Vanguard's inflation-protected securities</strong>. They adjust with inflation and currently yield around <strong>4%</strong>, contributing another <strong>$12,000</strong> a year.</p>\n\n<h2>5. $200,000 in VTI</h2>\n<p>This is <strong>Vanguard's total stock fund</strong>. It’s essential to maintain a small growth allocation because you're not dying tomorrow, nor is inflation. This would provide about <strong>$71,500</strong> a year without the need to sell any shares.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, this portfolio would yield around <strong>$71,500</strong> a year, allowing for a comfortable lifestyle in retirement, all without having to sell a single share.
