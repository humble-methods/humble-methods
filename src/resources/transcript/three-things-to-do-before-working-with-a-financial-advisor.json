  "content": "<h1>Three Essential Steps Before Hiring a Financial Advisor</h1>\n<p>If you are thinking about working with a financial advisor, you might want to do these three things first.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Be Aware of Fee-Only Advisors</h2>\n<p>Fee-only advisors do not operate the same as a flat annual fee advisor. These advisors often charge a percentage of your assets under management, typically around 1%. While paying $100 on a $10,000 investment might seem reasonable, consider this: paying $20,000 on a $2 million portfolio annually appears excessive for basic services.</p>\n<h2>2. Look for an Independent Advisor</h2>\n<p>Registered investment advisors are legally required to prioritize your interests over commissions. In contrast, big bank advisors may push proprietary products that serve their best interests instead of yours.</p>\n<h2>3. Read These Three Essential Books</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li><em>All About Asset Allocation</em> by Richard Fairchild</li>\n    <li><em>The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need</em> by Andrew Tobias</li>\n    <li><em>The Psychology of Money</em> by Morgan Housel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By reading these three books, you will gain knowledge equivalent to about 50% of the financial advisors I know. Moreover, you will gain the ability and confidence needed to invest independently, potentially saving you hundreds of thousands of dollars over your lifetime.</p>\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow for more content, and together we'll take steps toward achieving your financial goals.</p>",
