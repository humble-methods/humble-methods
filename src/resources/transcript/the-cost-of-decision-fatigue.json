  "content": "<h1>3 Reasons Decision Fatigue is Costing You Thousands</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Mental Exhaustion</h2>\n<p>By the time you decide between <strong>six toothpaste brands</strong>, <strong>five streaming services</strong>, and <strong>93 salad dressings</strong>, your brain is done. And you haven't even looked at your 401k yet!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Small Decisions Add Up</h2>\n<p>Most people do not fail financially because of big mistakes. They fail from a thousand tiny unmade decisions that accumulate over time.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Optimize Through Automation</h2>\n<p>You cannot optimize everything. The trick is to automate what matters and ignore the rest. Build systems today so you don't have to think about them tomorrow. The real cost of indecision is the compound interest you'll never earn.</p>",
