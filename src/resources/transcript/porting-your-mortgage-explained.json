You will need to reapply for a new mortgage with a new higher rate.</p> <p>They don't know I know this. Actually, I'd like to <strong>port my mortgage</strong> and transfer my existing interest rates and life of loan to a new property.</p> <p>How did you know about porting a mortgage?</p> <p>I just follow <em>Social Cap</em>. He makes complex finance easy.</p> <p>Well, he shouldn't have told you that, but we will still need to come and appraise the new home and run a credit check on you to make sure that you qualify for that same deal.</p> <p>That's fine, because Social Cap has also shown me many ways to improve my credit score.</p> <p>Check out the videos in the caption and like and follow <em>Social Cap</em> for more tips.</p>",
