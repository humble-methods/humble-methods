  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $1.5 Million in Retirement for Continuous Income</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in an S&P 500 Fund</h2>\n<p>I would put 90% of my portfolio, or <strong>$1.35 million</strong>, in an S&P 500 fund like Fidelity's FXAIX. This gives me exposure to some of the most profitable companies in the U.S.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Hold in a Money Market Fund</h2>\n<p>The remaining <strong>10%</strong>, or <strong>$150,000</strong>, would be kept in a money market fund like Fidelity's SPAXX. This provides liquidity and stability.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Monthly Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>On the second day of each month, I'd sell <strong>0.4%</strong> of the FXAIX, which would equate to about <strong>$64,800 a year pre-tax</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Annual Income from Money Market Fund</h2>\n<p>With a <strong>3.5% annual yield</strong> from SPAXX, I'd add an additional <strong>$5,250</strong> per year in income.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Projected Social Security Benefits</h2>\n<p>I'd project about <strong>$30,000</strong> a year from Social Security benefits, bringing my grand total to <strong>$100,000 a year pre-tax</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Tax Efficiency</h2>\n<p>If I keep my gross income under <strong>$98,900</strong> (married filing jointly, 2026), I pay <strong>0% tax</strong> on the FXAIX gains.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Growth Projection</h2>\n<p>If the market returns about <strong>7% in real terms</strong> on average per year and I'm only drawing down <strong>5%</strong>, then my portfolio is projected to continue to grow even as I'm spending it.</p>\n\n<h2>8. Sequence of Returns Protection</h2>\n<p>In case of a bad sequence of returns—like a market crash in my first couple of years—I have <strong>$150,000</strong> in a money market fund to tap into. I can spend during downturns and then replenish when the market recovers.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
