  "content": "<h1>Goldman Sachs Predicts Low S&P Returns for the Next Decade</h1>\n\n<p>Apparently, Goldman Sachs just announced that the S&P's return over the next decade will only average 3% per year. And here's the only thing I have to say about that.</p>\n\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<p>Putting aside the absurdity and arrogance of predicting the next 10 years of stock returns, when the majority of professional money managers can't predict what will happen to a stock in the next 10 seconds, let's assume that stocks tend to return 8% per year on average over the long term. Because they do.</p>\n\n<p>The long term is typically defined as anything over 20 years. So if the last decade returned 13%, what number could possibly work for the next decade so the 20-year average would indeed be 8%? Huh. Yes? Goldman?</p>\n\n<p>That's right. 3%. Stock returns will, in fact, revert to their mean as they've done throughout history. Goldman gets two gold stars for basic algebra and stating the obvious.</p>\n\n<p>Not to mention, if you're relying on stock returns over a 10-year time horizon, you shouldn't be invested in stocks in the first place. Goldman Sachs, huh?</p>",
