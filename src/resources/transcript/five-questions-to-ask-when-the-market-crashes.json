  "content": "<h1>5 Questions to Ask Yourself When the Market Crashes</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Was I Originally Planning on Reallocating My Assets Today?</h2>\n<p>If yes, then I do it. If no, then I don't.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Am I Comparing This Drop to an Arbitrary High-Water Mark?</h2>\n<p>Or am I looking at it in the context of an extended timeline, perhaps my original investing timeline?</p>\n\n<h2>3. Does My Current Allocation Match My Risk Tolerance Level?</h2>\n<p>If I can't stomach the loss that I'm seeing in the headlines, then no, I didn't invest appropriately, and I should adjust to prepare for future volatility.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Am I About to React by Preparing to Fight the Last Battle?</h2>\n<p>Meaning, am I about to reallocate my assets to adjust for what just happened, which is the past, and likely not the next market problem we'll face?</p>\n\n<h2>5. Am I Conflating the Market with the Economy?</h2>\n<p>Yes, political headlines can lead to short-term fluctuations, but throughout history, the market has never cared who was in office or what they did. It just continued its slow and steady march up and to the right. And as always, when that changes, I'll let you know.</p>",
