  "content": "<h1>Why RSUs Are Not a Retirement Plan</h1>\n<p>Here's why RSUs are not a retirement plan.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Don't Invest Where You Work</h2>\n<p>You already work there. Do you really want to invest there too? Remember, don’t invest where you eat, even if they do give you a free lunch and have an on-site ping pong room with a meditation thing.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Tax Holding Risks</h2>\n<p>Holding stock for tax reasons? Translation: you’re risking it all rather than paying the IRS a little tax. And guess what? One day you’re going to pay that piper no matter what. It might as well be when you still have something left to pay them with.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Double Risk Exposure</h2>\n<p>If the stock drops and layoffs hit, you lose twice, my friend. That’s not a job; that’s a loyalty program with a trap door. Don’t marry your employer; diversify as if you might actually need to leave quietly one day, as most of us do.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
