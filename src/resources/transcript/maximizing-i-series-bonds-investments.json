Here's how.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Personal Purchases</h2>\n<p>I bought <strong>$10,000</strong>. Your mother bought <strong>$10,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Custodial Accounts</h2>\n<p>We opened <strong>custodial accounts</strong> for you and your two sisters. Each of the three of you got <strong>$10,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Tax Refund Conversion</h2>\n<p>We used <strong>Form 8888</strong> to convert our tax refund to paper iBonds. That\u2019s another <strong>$10,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Business and Trust Purchases</h2>\n<p>I have a business and a living trust. Your mother has a business and a living trust as well. We bought iBonds in the name of each of those four entities. That adds another <strong>$40,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Current Yield</h2>\n<p>And the return on those is <strong>9.62%</strong> through October.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Important Considerations</h2>\n<p>Yep. Redirect.gov. Just have to be willing to hold them for one year. Remember, you lose <strong>three months</strong> of previous interest if you sell them before five years.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Learning Resources</h2>\n<p>Where did you learn all of this?</p>\n<p>Just follow <strong>Social Cap</strong>. He makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
