  "content": "<h1>The Four Index Funds I Would Buy and Hold for Life</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)</h2>\n<p>This fund holds major companies like <strong>Nvidia</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, and <strong>Apple</strong>, as well as smaller companies with potential for significant long-term growth. This will be your core investment through good times and bad.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invesco QQQM</h2>\n<p>This fund tracks the <strong>100 biggest tech companies</strong> in the NASDAQ, providing you with a heavier allocation to technology and growth.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD)</h2>\n<p>SCHD balances out your growth allocation with stable and mature dividend-paying companies like <strong>Chevron</strong>, <strong>Altria</strong>, and <strong>Pepsi</strong>. Important note: I would only invest in this within a tax-advantaged account to avoid taxes on dividends if I don't need the cash flow.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX)</h2>\n<p>SPAXX is currently returning about <strong>4%</strong> and invests in relatively safe short-term government securities like T-bills, providing both liquidity and peace of mind.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>By organizing my investments like this in just 10 minutes, I never have to pay a financial advisor <strong>1%</strong> of my assets to manage it for me. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week, I'll send you another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
