I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you succeed.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Start by opening a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> through a major brokerage firm. I\u2019ll explain why in a minute.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Set Up Automatic Transfers</h2>\n<p>Transfer <strong>$5.40 a day</strong> into that account. You can do this by linking a bank account directly to your Roth and setting up an automatic transfer.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in a Low-Cost Index Fund</h2>\n<p>Once the money is in the Roth, it\u2019s crucial to invest it. I would recommend buying a <strong>low-cost index fund</strong>. If you\u2019re having trouble finding the right index fund for you, simply Google <strong>best broad low-cost index funds of 2025</strong>. Look for responses from reputable sources like <strong>Morningstar</strong>, <strong>NerdWallet</strong>, or <strong>Yahoo Finance</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Set It and Forget It</h2>\n<p>Finally, once you\u2019ve got everything on autopilot, don\u2019t look at this account again until you\u2019re <strong>60</strong>. You\u2019ll most likely have just over <strong>$1 million</strong> waiting for you, and <strong>$920,000</strong> of that money will be newly created wealth and will be <strong>100% tax-free</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Easy Access to Contributions</h2>\n<p>And don\u2019t worry\u2014if you ever need any of that money back before age <strong>60</strong>, just remember you can take back your contributions at any time, <strong>penalty and tax-free</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
