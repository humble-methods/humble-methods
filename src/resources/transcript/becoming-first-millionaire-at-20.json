  "content": "<h1>Steps to Become the First Millionaire in Your Family at 20</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Start by opening a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> with a reputable firm such as <strong>Fidelity</strong>, <strong>Schwab</strong>, or <strong>Vanguard</strong>. It's free, easy, and will only take you about five minutes. Plus, you never have to use it if you don't want to.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Link Your Bank Account</h2>\n<p>Link your bank account to that Roth IRA to facilitate funding it regularly.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Commit to Weekly Contributions</h2>\n<p>Commit to funding it with <strong>$40 a week</strong>. That’s all you need! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Invest in Low-Cost Index Funds</h2>\n<p>Invest that money in a low-cost fund that tracks the S&P 500, such as <strong>Vanguard's VOO</strong>, <strong>Fidelity's FXAIX</strong>, or <strong>Schwab's SWPPX</strong>. Now you are invested in the world’s most profitable and stable companies.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Enjoy the Magic of Compound Growth</h2>\n<p>Here’s the magic when you start early: If you commit to the above until you're <strong>28 years old</strong> and never invest another penny again, you'd still likely have <strong>a million bucks</strong> waiting for you at retirement, all tax-free. </p>\n\n<h2>6. Continue the Plan for Greater Gains</h2>\n<p>If you maintain this plan after 28, you could very well end up with millions by retirement, all with a simple strategy: opening a Roth, funding it with $40 a week, and sticking to the plan.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my <strong>free weekly newsletter</strong> by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
