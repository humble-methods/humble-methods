If I add you as an authorized user to my credit card when you're 11 years old, you'll have an 800 credit score by the time you're 18 and be financially set for life.</p>\n\n<h2>The Role of Credit History</h2>\n<p>Uh-oh.</p>\n<p>What?</p>\n<p>It's not what Mom said.</p>\n\n<h2>Mom's Insight</h2>\n<p>What did Mom say?</p>\n<p>Mom said you're full of baloney.</p>\n<p>Baloney?</p>\n<p>Baloney. She said because you have terrible credit card history, it will actually end up hurting me because I will inherit your full history.</p>\n\n<h2>Stability Matters</h2>\n<p>She said most lenders won't give two bananas about my 800 score if I don't have stability of income and my own credit experience to back it up.</p>\n\n<h2>Good Credit Habits</h2>\n<p>And she said that unless you're willing to work with me on good credit habits, that you're setting me up for failure by learning to spend money that I don't have.</p>\n\n<h2>Liabilities of Unauthorized Charges</h2>\n<p>And is that all she said?</p>\n<p>Oh, she also said you're liable for all of my charges.</p>\n\n<h2>Culling Wisdom from Sources</h2>\n<p>Where did she learn all this?</p>\n<p>She just follows Social Cap. He makes complex finance seem easy.</p>\n<p>Your mother is always right.</p>",
