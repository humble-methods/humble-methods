  "content": "<h1>How I’d Invest a Million Dollars at 35, 45, and 55</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. At 35: Prioritize Flexibility</h2>\n<p>At <strong>35</strong>, I'd prioritize flexibility. I’d fill my <strong>Roth IRA</strong>, fund a brokerage account, and keep <strong>six to 12 months</strong> in liquid cash. I want options more than optimization.</p>\n\n<h2>2. At 45: Add Some Protection</h2>\n<p>At <strong>45</strong>, I'd add in some protection. I’d maximize tax-advantaged space, pay down strategic debt, and start prepping for my second act, not just retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>3. At 55: Think Decumulation Strategy</h2>\n<p>And at <strong>55</strong>, I would focus on decumulation strategy, tax efficiency, and withdrawal planning. Maybe even consider <strong>Roth conversions</strong>. A million dollars needs to work with you, not just for you. Same million, three decades, totally different playbooks. Time does change everything, even your investing strategy.</p>",
