  "content": "<h1>Unlock the Benefits of the Best Health Savings Account Today</h1>\n<p>Here is the number one financial account that you need to start taking advantage of right now. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<p>But before I tell you what this account is, here are the <strong>seven reasons why this is the gold standard of financial accounts:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your contributions are tax deductible.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The contributions to this account can be invested into funds that can take advantage of decades of compound growth.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Earnings grow tax-free.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Withdrawals, so long as spent on qualified expenses, are 100% tax-free.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The money in the account never disappears regardless of job changes or retirement.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The funds can be used on almost anything that has to do with your family's health and wellbeing.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>You don't even have to use this money right now. You can pay out of pocket, save the receipt, continue to let the funds grow untouched and uninterrupted, and 30 years down the road, take money out of the account and reimburse yourself for that cost.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is the <strong>Health Savings Account</strong>. And as long as you have a high deductible health plan with a minimum deductible of $1,600 single or $3,200 for your family, you too can take advantage of the single greatest tax advantaged account in the world.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
