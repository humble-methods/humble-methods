  "content": "<h1>How I Would Shelter 55% of My Income Legally</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Step-by-Step Breakdown</h2>\n<p>Number one, let's say my wife and I make <strong>$125,000</strong> a year pre-tax.</p>\n<p>Number two, I'd put <strong>$23,500</strong> into a traditional 401k, using an above the line deduction.</p>\n<p>Number three, I'd contribute <strong>$7,000</strong> into a traditional IRA, also with an above the line deduction. And yes, this is fully deductible because we make under <strong>$126,000</strong> gross.</p>\n<p>Number four, then I'd add <strong>$8,550</strong> into our family's health savings account, again with an above the line deduction.</p>\n<p>Number five, we take the cherry on top by applying the married filing joint standard deduction of <strong>$30,000</strong>.</p>\n<p>Finally, we'd inform the taxman that we only made <strong>$55,950</strong> of taxable income, even though we'll have close to six figures of disposable income.</p>\n\n<h2>Tax Bracket and Long-term Effects</h2>\n<p>By utilizing these strategies, we can shift from the <strong>22% marginal tax bracket</strong> to the <strong>12% marginal tax bracket</strong>. This planning will enable us to become millionaires in just under 17 years, alleviating concerns over unforeseen health expenses.</p>\n\n<p>If you found any of this helpful, please like and follow for more insights. I'll continue working to help you reach your financial goals!</p>",
