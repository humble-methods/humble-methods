  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $100,000 in Your 40s or 50s</h1>\n<p>Here is how I would invest <strong>$100,000</strong> if I were in my <strong>40s</strong> or <strong>50s</strong>. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help you make informed investment choices.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Balance Stability with Growth</h2>\n<p>I would start by balancing stability with growth. I would consider allocating a portion of my portfolio to <strong>blue chip stocks</strong>, <strong>government bonds</strong>, and <strong>real estate investment trusts (REITs)</strong>. Historically, blue chip stocks have averaged between <strong>7% and 10%</strong> annually. Government bonds provide a steady fixed income stream, and REITs offer attractive dividends.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Max Out Retirement Accounts</h2>\n<p>I would max out every one of my retirement accounts. Once you hit <strong>50</strong>, you can turbocharge your retirement savings with <strong>catch-up contributions</strong>. This means you can put an extra <strong>$1,000</strong> into your <strong>Roth IRA</strong> or a whopping <strong>$7,500</strong> into your <strong>401(k)</strong>. Imagine the impact of that extra <strong>$7,500</strong> annually over the next <strong>15 to 20 years</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Consolidate Old 401(k)s</h2>\n<p>I would take this opportunity to consolidate all of my old <strong>401(k)</strong>s. Not only does consolidating simplify management, but it also eliminates unnecessary administrative fees. Americans waste over <strong>$1,000</strong> annually on forgotten or unused 401(k)s.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Continue Investing in Growth Stocks</h2>\n<p>I would continue to invest in <strong>aggressive growth stocks</strong> just as I did in my 20s or 30s. Just because I\u2019m in my 40s doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m ready to play it safe! With the average retirement age in the US being <strong>65</strong>, you still have access to potentially two decades of growth (or even more). Remember, you don\u2019t even have to touch that traditional 401(k) until you\u2019re <strong>73</strong>, and you never have to touch the <strong>Roth IRA</strong> or <strong>Roth 401(k)</strong>, which can continue to grow indefinitely for you and your estate.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
