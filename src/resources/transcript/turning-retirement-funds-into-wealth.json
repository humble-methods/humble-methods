  "content": "<p>Hey dad, could you tell me something that seems illegal but isn't?</p> <p>Absolutely! I turned <strong>$2,000</strong> into <strong>$5 billion</strong> of tax-free wealth by taking advantage of a retirement account designed for middle-class savers.</p> <p>Is this just some secret of the rich? Nope! Anybody can take advantage of buying shares of startups and their <strong>Roth IRA</strong> for fractions of a penny.</p> <p>Isn't that pretty risky? Absolutely! Most of the startups went bankrupt, but a few of them went public and hit big. Really big.</p> <p>Your Roth was worth <strong>$2,000</strong>, and now it's worth <strong>$5 billion</strong>. When you retire and take that money out, you'll pay taxes on... <strong>None of it!</strong></p>",
