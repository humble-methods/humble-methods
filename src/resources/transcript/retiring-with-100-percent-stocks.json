Now, I create financial content to help you navigate your investments without added costs.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Investing in Stocks</h2>\n<p>My strategy involves investing 100% of my money in stocks, utilizing either a blue-chip dividend fund or individual dividend stocks, with an expectation of at least a 3% annual dividend yield.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Living Off My Portfolio</h2>\n<p>Since I can't rely solely on a 3% yield during my go-go golden years, I plan to sell an additional 4% of my stocks at the beginning of each year. That puts me at a 7% annual income.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Historical Returns</h2>\n<p>Historically, stocks have returned about 8% in real terms. With this plan, my portfolio is likely to triple over the next 15 years. The initial 3% dividend will easily cover my annual expenses.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Market Downturns</h2>\n<p>For those concerned about market downturns\u2014like a 25% drop in the first year of retirement\u2014consider this: If I don\u2019t sell and stick to my plan, in 20 years, I will have only doubled the value of my portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow for more insights, and I\u2019ll continue to guide you on your financial journey.</p>",
