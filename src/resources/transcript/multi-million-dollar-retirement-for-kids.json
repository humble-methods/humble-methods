  "content": "<h1>How Your Child Can Achieve a Multi-Million Dollar Retirement by Lifeguarding</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 1: Open a Custodial Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>First, open a custodial Roth IRA for your child in their name.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 2: Get a Lifeguarding Job</h2>\n<p>Encourage your child to secure a lifeguarding job as soon as they turn 15 years old. They should aim to earn <strong>$7,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 3: Invest in a Low-Cost Index Fund</h2>\n<p>After earning the money, advise them to invest <strong>$6,000</strong> of that amount into a low-cost index fund within the Roth IRA. Let them keep the remaining <strong>$1,000</strong>, as it may be challenging to get a 15-year-old to invest all their earnings.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 4: Annual Investment</h2>\n<p>Teach them the importance of doing this annually for the next <strong>50 years</strong>. By doing so, they can create a retirement fund of <strong>$2.5 million</strong>. Remarkably, <strong>$2.2 million</strong> of that total will be <strong>100% tax-free</strong> after they turn 59 and a half.</p>\n\n<p>And for the skeptics out there, I have already adjusted for inflation. Not bad for a <strong>$400 lifeguard certification</strong>.</p>",
