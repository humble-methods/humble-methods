  "content": "<h1>Three Essential Strategies for Achieving Stable Income in Retirement</h1>\n<p>Here are three ways that you can create truly stable income in retirement.</p>\n<p><strong>I'm Tyler.</strong> I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Short-Term Treasuries</h2>\n<p>This is by definition a risk-free asset class, and it's highly liquid in case of an emergency. However, it also will have the lowest returns of your fixed income options, hence risk-free.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Longer-Term Bonds or CDs</h2>\n<p>You might get a slightly higher return than on the short-term treasuries, but that return comes at a cost to you. You lose a little liquidity, and now you're also taking on a little interest rate risk. As interest rates go up, you lose a little value in your portfolio.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Whole Life Insurance with Cash Value</h2>\n<p>I'm not being paid to endorse these products, nor do I work for an insurance company. But if the name of the game is truly stability, you might consider whole life insurance with cash value. This can act as a buffer asset as it's protected on the downside and can supplement your annual income in the event of a market downturn.</p>\n<p>It also reduces sequence of returns risk as you wouldn't have to sell the investment part of your portfolio if the market took a dive in the first couple of years of your retirement. The cash value would tend to grow at a rate that would actually beat short-term treasuries while having the same risk-free component.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
