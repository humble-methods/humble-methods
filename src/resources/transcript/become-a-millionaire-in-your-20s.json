Here's what you need to do right now.</p>\n<p>First, open a brokerage account through platforms like <strong>E-Trade</strong>, <strong>Robinhood</strong>, or <strong>Acorns</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 2: Fund Your Account</h2>\n<p>Fund that account with <strong>$3.47 a day</strong>, and then invest that money into a low-cost index fund.</p>\n\n<h2>Recommended Funds</h2>\n<p>Some great options include <strong>Vanguard's VOO</strong> or <strong>Fidelity's FXAIX</strong>. That's it! That's all you have to do.</p>\n\n<h2>The Importance of Starting Now</h2>\n<p>But you have to start today, because if you wait until your 30s, you'll need to invest <strong>$9.20 each day</strong>.</p>\n<p>And if you wait until your 40s, now we're talking about <strong>$25.33 per day</strong>.</p>\n<p>It'll be eight times harder for you to become a millionaire if you wait until your 40s.
