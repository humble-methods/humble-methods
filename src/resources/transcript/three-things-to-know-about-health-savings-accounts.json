If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. You Can and Should Invest the Balance</h2>\n<p>Most people don't even know this is allowed and end up leaving their HSA funds in cash. If your provider lets you invest it, do it.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Pay Out of Pocket and Save the Receipt</h2>\n<p>Use regular cash for medical expenses today, and let your HSA continue to grow and compound. You can reimburse yourself in <strong>20 years</strong> tax-free. Yep, you can do that!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Take Advantage of Catch-Up Contributions</h2>\n<p>Once you hit age <strong>55</strong>, you can add an extra <strong>$1,000</strong> a year to the account. That's another <strong>$1,000</strong> growing tax-free for future healthcare needs. And yes, you will need it.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The HSA might not feel exciting, but I promise you it's one of the single greatest accounts you will ever use. Since we all need to spend money on our health, why not make it tax-free money?</p>",
