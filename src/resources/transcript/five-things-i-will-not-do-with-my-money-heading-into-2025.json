  "content": "<h2>Five Things I Will Not Do With My Money Heading Into 2025</h2>\n<p>Hello, I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I now create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it. Here are five things I will avoid with my money as we approach 2025:</p>\n\n<h3>1. Not Keeping Money in a High-Yield Savings Account</h3>\n<p>I will not keep my money in a high-yield savings account thinking it\u2019s a good long-term investment. By definition, it's not an investment at all. It's great for short-term needs, but with interest rates dropping, if this is for your long-term goals, wouldn't you rather have the return on that money going up, not down?</p>\n\n<h3>2. Not Investing Heavily in Stocks</h3>\n<p>I would not invest too heavily in stocks if you haven't already. The market has been on a tear, and while I don\u2019t have a crystal ball and don't time the market, I can assure you that the reckoning is coming. When it does, you always want to leave yourself an out if it's the only money you've got.</p>\n\n<h3>3. No Longer Investing in a Roth IRA</h3>\n<p>I will no longer be investing in a Roth IRA. Being over 40 and in a higher tax bracket, I believe I\u2019ll be in a much lower tax bracket when I retire and start taking distributions. I\u2019d prefer to take advantage of the tax benefits now in traditional and pre-tax accounts rather than in a Roth.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Not Paying Off My Mortgage Early</h3>\n<p>I still would not put one extra dime towards paying off my mortgage early. I locked in a 30-year fixed rate at 3.25%. As long as I can continue to achieve guaranteed post-tax returns elsewhere, I\u2019ll appreciate having cheap debt.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Continuing to Cut My Own Hair</h3>\n<p>Lastly, I\u2019m still not going to pay for a haircut. It\u2019s been five years of self-cuts, and it certainly beats whatever was happening to my head at Supercuts. Although that tea tree massage was worth the 20 bucks!</p>\n\n<p>If any of this has been helpful, please like and follow for more tips, and I\u2019ll continue to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
