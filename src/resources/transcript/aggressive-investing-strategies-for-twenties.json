  "content": "<h1>Aggressive Investing Strategies for Young Adults in Their 20s</h1>\n<p>If you are in your 20s and want to invest your money super aggressively, here are the three things I would do starting today.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>I would open a Roth IRA through Fidelity, and I would fund that account with $20 to $25 a week. If you ever need that money back, you can take back contributions to a Roth anytime penalty and tax-free.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in a Low-Cost Index Fund</h2>\n<p>I would invest that money in an aggressive low-cost index fund like Invesco's QQQM. This is a pretty volatile fund that tracks the 100 non-financial companies of the NASDAQ composite. It's mostly big tech, and it has returned about 14% over the last 30 years. Compare that to the S&P's 10%. That's a difference of about $2 million between QQQM and the S&P 500 over the last 30 years.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Automate Your Investments</h2>\n<p>And this is the truly important part: automate steps one and two so you never have to think about them again. You invest in your Roth when markets are up, and you invest in the Roth when markets are down.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
