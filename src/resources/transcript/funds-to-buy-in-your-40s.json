  "content": "<h1>Four Funds to Buy in Your 40s and Where to Put Them</h1>\n<p>Here are four funds I would buy in my 40s and exactly where I'd put them. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. 50% to FXAIX</h2>\n<p>I would allocate <strong>50%</strong> to <strong>FXAIX</strong>, Fidelity's S&P 500 index fund, in my traditional 401k. This allows me to get a tax deduction now while I'm in peak earning years, and it will compound tax-free until retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>2. 30% to VXUS</h2>\n<p>Next, I'd invest <strong>30%</strong> in <strong>VXUS</strong>, Vanguard's international fund, into my <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. Since international stocks are slightly less tax-efficient due to potential foreign tax credits, this is perfect for my Roth, where it will grow tax-free forever. I'll be diversified outside the U.S. to never kick myself when Asia goes on a bull run.</p>\n\n<h2>3. 15% to VSIAX</h2>\n<p>I'd allocate <strong>15%</strong> to <strong>VSIAX</strong>, Vanguard's U.S. small cap index, into my <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. This is my high-risk, high-reward play. Small cap value has historically outperformed, and while it can be a wild, volatile ride, it's perfect for my Roth where I won't be tempted to sell during downturns. If it 4Xs over the next 20 years, that's 100% tax-free, all mine.</p>\n\n<h2>4. 5% to VTI</h2>\n<p>Finally, I'd put <strong>5%</strong> into <strong>VTI</strong>, Vanguard's total stock fund, in my taxable brokerage account. This keeps it tax-efficient, flexible, and highly liquid. This serves as my \"maybe I want to retire early or take a sabbatical\" fund. It's available when I need it and grows tax-efficiently when I don't.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>To sum it all up: tax-inefficient investments go in tax-advantaged accounts, while tax-efficient investments go in taxable accounts.
