Because the market's down, I found a stock, <strong>stock B</strong>, and sold that for a <strong>$15,000</strong> loss. I used <strong>$10,000</strong> of that loss to completely offset the <strong>$10,000</strong> gain from stock A.</p>\n<p>What about the additional <strong>$5,000</strong> loss?</p>\n<p>We'll use <strong>$3,000</strong> of that to offset <strong>$3,000</strong> of my regular income this year. I\u2019ll use the remaining <strong>$2,000</strong> to offset <strong>$2,000</strong> of my regular income next year.</p>\n<p>Is this just something you can do because you have a lot of money?</p>\n<p>Nope! With a <strong>$1</strong> capital gain, just lock in a <strong>$1</strong> loss. No taxes.</p>\n<p>Where did you learn about this?</p>\n<p>I just follow <strong>Social Cat</strong>. He makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
