  "content": "<h1>Why I Quit My Six-Figure Job to Become a Full-Time Content Creator and Stay-at-Home Dog Dad</h1><p>Here are the top five reasons why I just quit my six-figure job to become a full-time content creator and stay-at-home dog dad. I'm calling it my retirement.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I'm unemployed.</p><h2>Reason 1: The Cult of Busyness</h2><p>Number three, I was done having people try to indoctrinate me into the cult of busyness. And it is a cult. Somewhere along the way, we collectively agreed to always pretend we're busy.</p><h2>Reason 2: The Illusion of Importance</h2><p>And not just to pretend we're busy, but to give each other badges of honor for being busy and stressed out and having more to do than anyone else. I'm not that important. Neither are you. We're rewarding people for not being okay.</p><h2>Reason 3: A New Approach to Work-Life Balance</h2><p>I don't want to play that game anymore, so let's normalize getting eight to nine hours of sleep a night. And let's normalize telling people at the office the next day that we're doing okay and actually meaning it.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>And my guess, just a guess, is we're actually going to get a lot more work done, and it's going to be of a much higher quality if we're actually rested, feeling optimal physically and mentally, and we have enough energy to get together and do something awesome. If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
