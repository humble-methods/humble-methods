  "content": "<h1>Top Four Reasons to Prioritize Funding a Taxable Brokerage Account Each Year</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. No Income Limits and No Contribution Limits</h2>\n<p>If you want to invest a quarter of a million bucks this year, you can. The flexibility of a taxable brokerage account allows you to contribute without any restrictions on income.</p>\n\n<h2>2. No Penalties for Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>One of the best features of a taxable brokerage account is that there are no penalties if you ever need to take back the money. This accessibility makes it an attractive option for many investors.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Favorable Tax Treatment on Capital Gains</h2>\n<p>Don't let the name 'taxable' fool you. If you hold on to your assets for more than one year, you will be taxed at a much lower rate on those capital gains compared to ordinary income. This is significant, especially heading into retirement or for those in a high tax bracket seeking extra income.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Supplementing Income During Retirement</h2>\n<p>This is the account I will personally use to bridge my life from the ages of 62 to 73. I need to supplement my income on top of Social Security, allowing my deferred tax and tax-free accounts to continue to grow for future needs.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
