This year, I believe you owe me a <strong>$2,000 refund</strong>.</p> <p>Oh great. That was close.</p> <p>What do you mean, great? I thought you knew a thing or two about taxes, huh?</p> <p>Well, most people don't know this, but getting money back as a refund isn't exactly a good thing.</p> <p>Of course it is. It's a refund.</p> <p>You see, that's what we want you to think. That $2,000 was never ours to begin with; it's your money. You just decided to give it to us for a year.</p> <p>I don't know why, and we paid you <strong>0% interest</strong> on it.</p> <p>But I could have invested that money and made <strong>5%</strong> in a high-yield savings account.</p> <p>Yep, and instead you probably got that <strong>5%</strong> off of my money.</p> <p>Yep. Well, that's even worse than paying taxes.</p>",
