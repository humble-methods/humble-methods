  "content": "<h1>The Best Accounts You Should Consider Heading into 2025</h1> \n<p>Hi, I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free to help you navigate your financial journey without the cost.</p> \n\n<h2>1. Health Savings Account (HSA)</h2> \n<p>The first account I recommend considering is a <strong>Health Savings Account (HSA)</strong>. You might not be eligible for one, but if you are and you have a high deductible health plan, it is the only <strong>triple tax-advantaged account</strong> in the world. Here\u2019s how it works:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Contributions are tax-deductible.</li> \n<li>Contributions can be invested and grow tax-free.</li> \n<li>All withdrawals are tax-free, as long as they are spent on qualifying medical expenses.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If health isn\u2019t your primary concern, don\u2019t worry! At age 65, you can use those funds however you wish; you just have to pay taxes on the income.</p> \n\n<h2>2. Traditional 401(k) or IRA</h2> \n<p>The second option is a <strong>traditional 401(k)</strong> or IRA. You might have thought I\u2019d mention a Roth account, but if you're in your 40s or 50s and at or near the height of your earning power, you\u2019re probably in a relatively high tax bracket. It may be more beneficial to defer those taxes until retirement, when you are likely to be in a lower tax bracket than now.</p> \n<p>The Roth is cool, but it might be more appropriate for 2024.</p> \n\n<h2>3. Taxable Brokerage Account</h2> \n<p>Lastly, consider a <strong>taxable brokerage account</strong>. This account allows you to invest your money with complete access before age 59 and a half. Personally, I invested in a couple of low-cost growth funds back in my 20s, and now I can withdraw about $5,000 to $10,000 annually from that account in the form of capital gains. This income is taxed at a much lower rate than if it were ordinary income.</p> \n<p>You can also put your ordinary income into a <strong>SEP IRA</strong> for additional retirement savings.</p> \n\n<p>If any of this content is helpful, please like and follow for more insights to help you get one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
