We do have the products for you.</p>\n<h2>Exploring Life Insurance Options</h2>\n<p>Ooh, like term life? Affordable and practical?</p>\n<p>No, no, we have much better. IULs, MPIs, infinite banking.</p>\n<h2>Questions About the Products</h2>\n<p>What are those?</p>\n<p>Oh, we don't really know, but we're selling them as magic millionaire makers.</p>\n<h2>Regulatory Concerns</h2>\n<p>Isn't that a violation of insurance laws and regulations?</p>\n<p>Tyler, please, we're fiduciaries.</p>\n<h3>Important Updates from Major Players</h3>\n<p>Huh, because MassMutual just issued an email to all of its agents telling them to stop selling life insurance products effective immediately as wealth building tools.</p>\n<p>Where did you get that email? Said that it was misleading, a violation, that it uses life insurance products inappropriately by promoting large deposits with immediate access\u2014violation\u2014and that it results in a higher risk of lapse of policy for customers and agents because they don't really know what the products are. So a violation.</p>\n<h2>Transparency in the Finance Industry</h2>\n<p>You're absolutely right. Well, that's not even a public document. Nobody's gonna believe you.</p>\n<p>If only I had a platform to share the truth and transparency about the finance industry.</p>",
