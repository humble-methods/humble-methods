  "content": "<h1>How Money Gets Passed Down Emotionally Before Financially</h1>\n<p>If this sounds like you, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Stressful Money Conversations</h2>\n<p>If money is always stressful for you when your kids are growing up, they will inherit that emotion and may avoid money as adults. Teach <strong>calm, not fear</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Moralizing Money</h2>\n<p>If you treat money as purely moral, where all spending is bad and saving is a virtue, your kids may grow up financially paralyzed, and it's your fault. Well, it’s probably your parents' and grandparents' faults too.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Importance of Open Discussions</h2>\n<p>If you avoid talking about money, your kids will learn from somewhere else. I promise you’d rather have them learn this from you than from the thousands of scammers out there imitating my account, offering wonderful opportunities in <strong>NFTs</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, check out the podcast, but more importantly, go talk to your kids about money!</p>",
