I live at home with you to cut back on expenses.</p>\n\n<h2>Smart Investments</h2>\n<p>Work a few hours on the weekend. I've been putting $500 a month into my Roth IRA.</p>\n<p><strong>The account will be worth just under a million by the time I'm 48.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Planning for Retirement</h2>\n<p>I'll most likely retire with a little over $5 million.</p>\n<p><strong>Isn't that more than you have from working a 9-to-5 your entire life?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm going back to bed.
