  "content": "<h1>Five Essential Strategies for Millennials to Become Millionaires Early</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Number five:</strong> Check your email <strong>three times a day max</strong>. Your time is literally your money, and you're currently allowing other people to steal that time and money. Remember that every single email you get is a direct imposition on your time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Number four:</strong> Do not automate subscription service payments ever. I want you staring at how much money you're throwing out the window on those forgotten Hulu Plus premium packages every single month.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Number three:</strong> If you're looking for genuine financial advice, check <a href='https://www.morningstar.com'>Morningstar</a> or <a href='https://finance.yahoo.com'>Yahoo Finance</a>. These are certainly not the only investment resources on the internet, but they are some of the most reliable. Please do not rely solely on TikTok and other forms of social media to get your investment advice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Number two:</strong> Read <em>Jim Collins' Good to Great</em> immediately. If you don't have time to read it, fine, I'll just give you the punchline: The number one thing keeping you from being great is that you're already good.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finally, number one:</strong> <strong>Do automate paying yourself first.</strong> This includes your retirement, college savings, or even a spending account that you are saving up for a vacation. The bottom line is, you should make the right decision once and never have to make it again for the rest of your life.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep putting up lists.</p>",
