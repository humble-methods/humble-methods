  "content": "<h1>The Importance of Controlling What You Can in Your Investments</h1>\n<p>If I could offer you one piece of advice heading into <strong>2025</strong>, it\u2019s this: always control what you can control. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help guide you on your investment journey.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding Investment Success Rates</h2>\n<p>It may seem simple, but let\u2019s analyze it. If you retire and are invested <strong>75%</strong> in stocks and <strong>25%</strong> in fixed income, you\u2019d have about a <strong>96%</strong> chance of never running out of money. But what happens when you involve fees?</p>\n\n<h2>Impact of Management Fees</h2>\n<p>If you pay someone a <strong>1%</strong> fee to manage that money, your success rate drops to <strong>84%</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you pay them another <strong>1%</strong> (whether you know it or not), because they\u2019ve placed you in a bunch of fancy mutual funds, well, now you only have a <strong>65%</strong> chance of never running out of funds.</p>\n\n<h2>Recognizing the Irony</h2>\n<p>I hope we all see the irony here: if money managers are charging you a percentage of your assets under management and then suggesting you might have trouble retiring, now we know why.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll continue sharing insights to help you get one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
