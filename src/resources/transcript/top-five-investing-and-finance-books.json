I\u2019m a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need by Andrew Tobias</h2>\n<p>This is literally, and I\u2019m using the word literally, literally the only investment guide you\u2019ll ever need.</p>\n\n<h2>2. The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel</h2>\n<p>This is a page turner, and it will tell you exactly why you make boneheaded moves every single day of your life, even though you know they\u2019re terrible financial ideas.</p>\n\n<h2>3. All About Asset Allocation by Richard Fairey</h2>\n<p>This one will give you about 50 model portfolios for all different types of time horizons, asset class selection, and risk tolerances.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Die With Zero by Bill Perkins</h2>\n<p>This one I needed to read because my mistake is never spending any of my money. This book is a brilliant thought exercise from start to finish.</p>\n\n<h2>5. The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss</h2>\n<p>No single book has influenced the course of my life or thought process more than this one. If you\u2019re fed up and ready for a change, this might be the book that you didn\u2019t know you needed to read right now.</p>\n\n<p>And if any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
