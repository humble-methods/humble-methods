  "content": "<p>I&#39;ll bet I make way more money as an investment banker than you do as a teacher in New Hampshire. Maybe. Let&#39;s see how this one plays out.</p>\n<p>My starting salary is <strong>$150,000</strong> right out of undergrad. And that&#39;s just the base salary. I moved to the city, bought an <strong>Audi A4</strong>, and a brand new <strong>Rolex</strong>. You know, because I&#39;m super successful, and that&#39;s what successful people do.</p>\n<p>Awesome! My starting salary was only <strong>$40,000</strong>, but I moved to New Hampshire with no income tax, got a small house near my friends, bought a used <strong>Subaru Outback</strong>, and I bought my first <strong>Timex</strong>. That looks a lot like my Rolex.</p>\n<p>I make over <strong>$400,000</strong> a year now as Vice President, upgraded to an <strong>Escalade</strong>, and not only do I have multiple Rolex watches, but I now have a few <strong>Patek Philippe</strong>. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard how much those cost.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve only gotten a <strong>$10,000</strong> raise over the last decade, but because I learned to live on less at an early age, I&#39;ve just invested all that extra money into my <strong>IRA</strong>. And I never needed a new watch, because my Timex still works.</p>\n<p>Sure, that&#39;s not my Rolex? It seems like every time I get a fancy car or watch, my friends just get something even fancier. I can&#39;t keep up with this. I gotta move to <strong>Greenwich</strong> now and start throwing elite parties just to keep up with them.</p>\n<p>I still have the same place in New Hampshire, only paid off. My retirement account has over <strong>a million bucks</strong> thanks to 30 years of compound growth. Who knew that just a little each month could grow so large? Who knew my Timex would last for 30 years? Okay, give me my Rolex back. I might need to sell it.</p>",
