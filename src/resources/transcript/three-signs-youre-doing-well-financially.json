  "content": "<h1>3 Signs You're Doing Well Financially Heading into 2025</h1>\n<p>Here are three signs that you're doing pretty well financially as we head into 2025. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to benefit you without the costs.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Contributing to a Retirement Plan</h2>\n<p>If you're actively contributing to a retirement plan, you're statistically doing better than <strong>50%</strong> of Americans. This is a crucial step in securing your financial future.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Prioritizing Wealth Over Status</h2>\n<p>Ever wonder why I wear the same clothes in every video and have a less-than-stellar haircut? It\u2019s because I don\u2019t care about the appearance of status. I focus on what's in my financial accounts. With <strong>40%</strong> of people lacking sufficient funds in any financial accounts to sustain their lifestyle if they lost their job, we have a significant issue.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Measuring Success Against Yourself</h2>\n<p>Another sign of doing well is measuring your success against yourself, not others. Spoiler alert: there will always be someone wealthier than you. Stop worrying about how much your neighbor, Sally, makes; the odds are that if you think she earns a lot, it's because she wants you to perceive that way. Often, she\u2019s prioritizing status over real wealth and is probably worth much less than you think.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep working to guide you one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
