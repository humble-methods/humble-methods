  "content": "<h1>Why Paying 1% to a Financial Advisor is a Costly Mistake on the Path to Financial Freedom</h1> <p>Here is why paying 1% to a financial advisor over the course of your investing career is the single biggest mistake you will ever make on the path to financial freedom. I\u2019m Tyler, I\u2019m a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p> <h2>1. The Performance Drag</h2> <p>Let\u2019s say you put $1,000 into an index fund and invest it at 7% over the next 30 years. You'll most likely have just over $1.13 million waiting for you. But give that same $1,000 a month to a financial advisor, have them invest in the same index funds, and now instead of 7%, you get a 6% return for the next 30 years. That would result in only $948,000. It's a $65,000 performance drag.</p> <h2>2. Diminishing Returns in Retirement</h2> <p>Once you retire, you're told that you would be safe taking about 4% of your assets to live off of on an annual basis. Congratulations, 25% of that annual income just went to your advisor.</p> <h2>3. The Cost Over Time</h2> <p>Because it's in percentage terms, it won't look like much early on. If you have a $50,000 portfolio, you\u2019ve just paid 500 bucks for a year of decent services. But now in retirement, you're paying $30,000 annually for your $3 million portfolio. That\u2019s 60 times more expensive for basically identical services. Got it.</p>",
