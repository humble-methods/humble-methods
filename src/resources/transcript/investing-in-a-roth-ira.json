  "content": "<h1>How to Invest in a Roth IRA in Your 20s or 30s</h1>\n<p>If I were in my 20s or 30s, here’s exactly how I’d invest in a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Choose Low-Cost Index Funds</h2>\n<p>Start with <strong>low-cost index funds</strong> because I’m not smarter than the market. I might just be a lot louder on social media.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Focus on Total Market or S&P 500</h2>\n<p>Pick funds that track either the <strong>total market</strong> or the <strong>S&P 500</strong>. Broad, boring, beautiful.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Max Out Every Year</h2>\n<p>Max it out every year you can and <strong>forget about it</strong>. Seriously, forget about it! I’ll try to remind you daily from my cabin, where I intentionally don’t have good enough service to check any of this daily.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Consistency Over Charisma</h2>\n<p>Remember, compound interest doesn’t care how cool you are—it rewards consistency, not charisma.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
