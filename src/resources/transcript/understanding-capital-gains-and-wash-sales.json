Because my Bitcoin went from <strong>$60,000</strong> to <strong>$15,000</strong>. I just sold it to lock in the losses on paper that offset the gains from the other stocks.</p> <p>But it says here you still own one Bitcoin.</p> <p><strong>Tyler:</strong> Yep. I sold it at <strong>1 PM</strong> and bought it back at <strong>1:05 PM</strong>.</p> <p>You can't do that. You have to wait <strong>30 days</strong> to rebuy it or it's considered a wash sale.</p> <p>So, Bitcoin is still classified as property, not as a security. Therefore, the wash sale rule doesn't apply.</p> <p><strong>Tyler:</strong> So I owe you nothing.</p> <p>That's right.</p>",
