  "content": "<h1>Funding Your Child's Education and Retirement</h1>\n<p>Here's exactly how I would use <strong>$100,000</strong> to fund my child's entire education and their entire retirement. I'm <strong>Tyler</strong>, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 1: Establishing a 529 College Savings Plan</h2>\n<p>Number one, I would give my own parents, my child's grandparents, <strong>$18,000</strong> each this year and next year. I would have them open a <strong>529 college savings plan</strong> in my child's name and invest the <strong>$72,000</strong> in a low-cost index option. I would recommend opening this plan in <strong>Utah</strong> or <strong>New York</strong>, as those are two of the states with the best investment options and potential tax deductions.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 2: Encouraging Early Work Experience</h2>\n<p>Next, when my child is <strong>10</strong>, <strong>11</strong>, <strong>12</strong>, and <strong>13</strong>, I would find a way to have them work for my small business. They could help me post my financial content, create thumbnails, or even learn some basic accounting. I would pay them <strong>$7,000</strong> a year, which would go into a <strong>custodial Roth IRA</strong>, invested in low-cost index funds.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 3: Projecting Future Value</h2>\n<p>By the time my child turns <strong>18</strong>, they would most likely have a college account worth about <strong>$350,000</strong> of tax-free money, as long as it's spent on qualified education. Additionally, without ever needing to touch or contribute to that custodial Roth again, it would become theirs at <strong>18</strong> and would likely be worth about <strong>$2.86 million</strong> when they are close to retirement\u2014again, 100% tax-free.</p>\n\n<p>Not bad for <strong>$100,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
