  "content": "<h1>The Most Important Lesson About Money and Success</h1>\n<p>Here is the single most important lesson you will ever learn about money and success. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Power of Small Efforts</h2>\n<p>Success is nothing more than the sum of small efforts repeated day in, day out. For instance, investing <strong>$3.57</strong> a day into your Roth IRA in your 20s can equal a tax-free millionaire by retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Consistency in Endeavors</h2>\n<p>Three minutes and <strong>50 seconds of posting</strong> on social media each day can lead to the end of your W-2 job forever.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Pitfall of Immediate Gratification</h2>\n<p>Most people will never achieve either because they expect results immediately and then quit. So tomorrow, put <strong>$3.57</strong> into a Roth IRA and invest it in low-cost index funds. Spend three minutes and <strong>50 seconds</strong> posting a video on social media talking about something you love or any topic you'd like to market. Do both of those things for one year and watch what happens.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
