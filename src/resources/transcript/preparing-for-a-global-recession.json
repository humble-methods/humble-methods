Accumulate Cash</h2>\n<p>Get your hands on as much <strong>cash</strong> as possible because we're about to see a stock market sale that only comes around once in a generation.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Pay Down Credit Card Debt</h2>\n<p>Pay down your <strong>credit card debt</strong> immediately. Rising variable rates will eat you alive. If this is hard for you, look into a <strong>0% balance transfer</strong> option.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Understand Healthcare Costs</h2>\n<p>Before anyone lays a hand on you in a hospital, make sure you get the <strong>cash rate</strong> first. Even healthcare providers are just looking out for themselves right now.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Consider Egg-Laying Chickens</h2>\n<p>Get your hands on <strong>two egg-laying chickens</strong>. Chickens? Yes, son. With a national egg shortage and prices of eggs up over <strong>50%</strong> since July, you could do far worse things with your money.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Make Yourself Indispensable at Work</h2>\n<p>Make yourself <strong>indispensable at work</strong>. But I'm a 39-year-old lifeguard. Then go save <strong>five lives</strong> today, son. Just make sure you don't do it until your boss is watching.</p>\n\n<p>Taking these steps can help you navigate the challenges of a recession. Stay proactive and prepared!</p>",
