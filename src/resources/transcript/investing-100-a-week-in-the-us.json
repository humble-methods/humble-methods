  "content": "<h1>How $100 a Week Could Turn into a Million Bucks of Tax-Free Money</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I create financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Choose a Legit Firm</h2>\n<p>Start by picking a legit firm like <strong>Fidelity</strong>, <strong>Schwab</strong>, or <strong>Vanguard</strong>. The more boring the name, the more trustworthy they are with your money.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Open a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. It’ll take you about <strong>five minutes</strong>. Link your bank account and set up weekly auto transfers. Touch it once, and it will build forever.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest Inside the Roth</h2>\n<p>Don’t let the money sit in cash within the Roth. I’d personally drop it into a growth fund like <strong>Vanguard's VUG</strong>, which owns giants like <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Meta</strong>, and <strong>Apple</strong>. This way, you're riding the same wave as the companies that run the world.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Consistent Contribution</h2>\n<p>Do this every week for <strong>40 years</strong>, and that <strong>$100</strong> a week could become about <strong>$850,000</strong>. After age <strong>59 and a half</strong>, every penny of it is yours—no taxes, no penalties, just your money.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So, if you’ve got $100 and a Wi-Fi signal, you’ve got a millionaire’s plan. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
