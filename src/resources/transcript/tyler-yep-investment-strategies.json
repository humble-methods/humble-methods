I don't even know it's there.</p>  <p><strong>Tyler:</strong> Why would you do that?</p>  <p><strong>Other Person:</strong> I always pay myself first.</p>  <p><strong>Tyler:</strong> But what about all the cool things you want to buy?</p>  <p><strong>Other Person:</strong> Oh, give it a few years! I'll be buying all those things and more just from the passive income off of those investments. Not to mention the amount of money I saved by paying you less each year.</p>  <p><strong>Tyler:</strong> So instead of continuing to work for your money until you're 70, money will continue to work for me. And I'll retire by 60.</p>",
