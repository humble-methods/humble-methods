  "content": "<h1>Smart Investment Strategies for Individuals in Their 40s and 50s</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how I would invest <strong>$100,000</strong> if I were in my 40s or 50s. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in a No-Cost Index Fund</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>40%</strong> of my assets in a no-cost index fund like <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com\" target=\"_blank\">Fidelity's FNILX</a>. This is practically identical to an S&P 500 index fund, but because they don't have to pay a fee for using the name S&P, it can get away with <strong>zero in fees</strong>. I'll take it!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in a Dividend Fund</h2>\n<p>I would then allocate <strong>30%</strong> into a dividend fund like <a href=\"https://www.schwab.com\" target=\"_blank\">Schwab's SCHD</a>. This provides me with just under a <strong>3.5% annual dividend return</strong>, helping to supplement my daily excursions to Jersey Mike's. Plus, I get to retain the underlying assets that hopefully appreciate over time.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in a Money Market Fund</h2>\n<p>Finally, I would invest the remaining <strong>30%</strong> into a money market fund such as <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com\" target=\"_blank\">Fidelity's SPRXX</a>. This currently returns about <strong>5%</strong> and allows me to take advantage of a high interest rate environment. Additionally, it provides quick and easy access to cash if I want to buy more of either option one or option two at a discount, or even put bacon on my number seven at Jersey Mike's.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, <strong>like</strong> and <strong>follow</strong> for more insights, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
