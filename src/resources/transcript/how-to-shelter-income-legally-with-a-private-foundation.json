  "content": "<h1>How to Shelter 30% of Your Income Legally with a Private Family Foundation</h1>\n<p>Hello, I\u2019m Tyler, the former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free so that you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 1: Create a Private Family Foundation</h2>\n<p>First off, I would begin by creating a private family foundation. Yes, it\u2019s going to be a headache and will require a lot of regulatory and legal oversight. But if I have millions of dollars, it\u2019s not a problem.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 2: Contribute to the Foundation</h2>\n<p>Next, I would put 30% of my adjusted gross income into said foundation annually. This is 100% tax-free. So, imagine I have 10 million bucks in the foundation; there\u2019s a $4 million tax break!</p>\n\n<h2>Step 3: Hire Family Members</h2>\n<p>Next, I would hire my two kids to run the foundation and pay them each $200,000 a year from the foundation\u2019s tax-exempt assets.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 4: Understand the Payout Requirements</h2>\n<p>So what\u2019s the catch? Each year, I\u2019d need to pay out 5% of the foundation\u2019s assets to charity.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 5: Creating Your Own Family Government</h2>\n<p>But guess what? Now, instead of giving my money to the government in the form of taxes, I\u2019ve effectively created my own family government. I can distribute that money to my own friends who run charities, and I can and will benefit directly and indirectly with future influence.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 6: Long-Term Growth</h2>\n<p>Finally, since I only have to pay out 5% annually and the foundation\u2019s assets are projected to grow at 7-8% annually, the foundation\u2019s value will continue to grow. This allows me and my family to continue to use those assets to benefit myself, my family, and my friends forever. And if that doesn\u2019t make you question why the rich and famous have private foundations, I don\u2019t know what will.</p>",
