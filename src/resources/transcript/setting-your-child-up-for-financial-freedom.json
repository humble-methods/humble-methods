  "content": "<h1>3 Steps to Set Your Child Up for Financial Freedom</h1>\n<p>Here are three things I would do to set your child up for a lifetime of financial freedom. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help guide your financial decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Custodial Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>I would go to E-Trade, Schwab, Fidelity, or Vanguard and open a <strong>custodial Roth IRA</strong> in their name. This process will take you about <strong>15 minutes</strong>. Yes, even babies can be eligible for a custodial Roth IRA, as this account is based on earned income, not age.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Fund the Account with Earned Income</h2>\n<p>Next, I would fund that account with your child\u2019s earned income. But Tyler, you might ask, how the heck is my child supposed to have earned income? As long as the work is safe and age-appropriate, they could be a <strong>W-2 employee</strong> for your small business, perhaps posing in your social media campaign, or they could work as a self-employed babysitter or dog walker. If you fund that account with a one-time contribution of <strong>$7,000</strong> when they are <strong>10 years old</strong>, they could potentially be a millionaire by age <strong>59 and a half</strong>. And that\u2019s just from a one-time contribution!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Educate About the Account's Value</h2>\n<p>Finally, remind them that this account is literally the <strong>gold standard</strong> of accounts, as decades of compound earnings are <strong>100% tax-free</strong> after they turn <strong>59 and a half</strong>. If they can\u2019t wait that long to touch the money, they can withdraw their contributions at any time <strong>penalty and tax-free</strong> to buy a toy boat or a real boat. Additionally, after the account has been open and funded for <strong>five years</strong>, they can use up to <strong>$10,000</strong> of the earnings <strong>penalty-free</strong> for college tuition or to put towards their first house.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you and your child one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
