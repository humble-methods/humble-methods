I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free.</p>\n\n<h2>Start Your Investment Journey</h2>\n<p>If you were to invest <strong>$300 a month</strong> starting today into a low-cost index fund like Vanguard's VOO or Fidelity's FXAIX, you would most likely have just under <strong>$300,000</strong> waiting for you at retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>The Power of Compound Interest</h2>\n<p>The fascinating part is that just under <strong>$200,000</strong> of that money would be from <strong>compound interest</strong> alone. Just by putting that <strong>$300 a month</strong> into a low-cost index fund and investing it, you could have an additional <strong>$200,000</strong> of created wealth waiting for you at retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>Your Choice</h2>\n<p>Or you could just keep telling yourself it's too late and invest <strong>$0 a month</strong> and have <strong>$0</strong> waiting for you at retirement. Your call.</p>",
