  "content": "<h1>Five Funds to Invest in and Hold for Life at 18</h1>\n<p>Here are the five funds that I would invest in and hold for life if I were 18 years old. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. VTI - Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF</h2>\n<p>This is your own literally everything fund, and you're buying companies like <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Tesla</strong>, and that little regional pizza chain in Tulsa that somehow went public. It gives you exposure to the entire U.S. stock market.</p>\n\n<h2>2. VXUS - Vanguard Total International Stock ETF</h2>\n<p>Because America doesn't win every decade, and you're buying shares from <strong>Europe</strong>, <strong>Asia</strong>, emerging markets, basically everywhere that isn't the U.S. Some years this will lag, others it will crush. Either way, you're diversified and you'll never have international FOMO.</p>\n\n<h2>3. VSIAX - Vanguard Small Cap Value Index</h2>\n<p>This is where it gets a little spicy. <strong>Small cap value stocks</strong> historically outperform over the long run, but they're also volatile as H-E double hockey sticks. If you're 18 and can stomach watching this fund drop 40% in a week, you'll likely be rewarded in 30 years.</p>\n\n<h2>4. QQQM - Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF</h2>\n<p>This is QQQ's younger, slightly cheaper sibling. If you believe that tech will keep eating the world, this is your best bet.</p>\n\n<h2>5. SGOV - iShares Short-Term T-Bill Fund</h2>\n<p>And here's why. Putting five to 10% of your portfolio in <strong>T-bills</strong> ensures you have something stable when the market drops, preventing your brain from screaming at you to sell everything or feeling frustrated because you can't buy something.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works. And I'll see you in the next one.</p>",
