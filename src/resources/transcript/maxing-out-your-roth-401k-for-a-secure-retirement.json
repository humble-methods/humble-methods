  "content": "<h2>Maxing Out Your Roth 401k: A Conversation</h2>\n<p>Tyler: Yep, says here. You'll be retiring with <strong>3.3 million dollars</strong> in your <strong>Roth 401k</strong>.</p>\n<p>Friend: Yep. That can't be right. You only contributed <strong>$225,000</strong> to this account.</p>\n<p>Tyler: Oh, yeah, I maxed out my 401k each year in my 20s and then I never touched the account again.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding Roth 401k Contributions</h2>\n<p>Friend: But can't you only contribute <strong>$6,500</strong> a year to this account?</p>\n<p>Tyler: No, it's a <strong>Roth 401k</strong>. The maximum contribution is actually <strong>$22,500</strong> a year. It just took it right out of my paycheck, so I never had to see it and I learned to live on less.</p>\n\n<h2>Tax Implications</h2>\n<p>Friend: Well, we'll be waiting for our taxes on that <strong>$3.3 million</strong> when you retire.</p>\n<p>Tyler: No, it's a <strong>Roth 401k</strong>. I already paid taxes on that money back in my 20s when I was in a much lower tax bracket.</p>\n\n<h2>Withdrawal Rules</h2>\n<p>Friend: Well, you can't touch that money until you're <strong>59 and a half</strong>.</p>\n<p>Tyler: No, it's a <strong>Roth 401k</strong>. I can take back the contributions whenever I want for whatever I want.</p>\n\n<h2>Distribution Requirements</h2>\n<p>Friend: Well, you have to start taking that money out at <strong>72</strong>.</p>\n<p>Tyler: Nope, I don't. It's a <strong>Roth 401k</strong> and I never have to take distributions. I actually plan on leaving that money in the account for my children.</p>\n\n<h2>Passing on Wealth Tax-Free</h2>\n<p>Friend: Well, we'll get our money when you pass it on to them.</p>\n<p>Tyler: Well now you're really gonna be upset when I die. The profits on this account kind of magically disappear and my kids get all of that money tax-free\u2014all because you maxed out your 401k in your 20s.</p>\n<p>Friend: Yep. Well, see you later.</p>",
