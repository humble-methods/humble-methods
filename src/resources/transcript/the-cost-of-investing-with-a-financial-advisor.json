Oh, wait. Those numbers seem off.</p>\n<p>Oh, sorry. That’s how much money you’ll <strong>lose</strong> from your retirement in fees. Really messed that one up!</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
