  "content": "<h1>My Paycheck Plan for Achieving Long-Term Wealth</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I spend most of my time working on a new podcast. If any of this is helpful, tune in by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Pay Down Toxic Debt</h2>\n<p>100% of my disposable income—meaning the money I do not spend on immediate needs like food and shelter—goes to paying down <strong>toxic debt</strong>, a.k.a. credit card debt, the killer of all your wealth dreams. Anyone who says otherwise is a ding-dong.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Fund a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>\n<p>If that's taken care of, I'd put <strong>5%</strong> of each paycheck into a <strong>high-yield savings account</strong> to pay for my short and mid-term needs. Why? Because I could be earning <strong>4-5%</strong> on that money versus <strong>0.1%</strong> in a traditional savings account or a checking account.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Max Out My 401k</h2>\n<p>If that's sorted out, I’d put as much money as I could towards my <strong>401k</strong> while getting whatever company match my employer is willing to give. Why? Because it's a free raise for doing absolutely nothing but being super smart with your money.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Contribute to a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Once that's taken care of, I’d put <strong>10%</strong> of each paycheck into a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> and invest it in <strong>low-cost index funds</strong>. Call it a day! That allows for growth and tax-free spending after age <strong>59 and a half</strong>. If you need the money, you can take back contributions any time, penalty and tax-free.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Utilize a Health Savings Account</h2>\n<p>Finally, if all that’s covered, put <strong>10%</strong> into a <strong>health savings account (HSA)</strong> and invest it in low-cost index funds. Yep, you can do that! This ensures you never have to worry about paying a dime on health expenses ever again.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Money doesn't have to be complicated, but it does need a system. And this, bluntly, is a pretty good one.</p>",
