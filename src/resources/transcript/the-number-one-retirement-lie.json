  "content": "<h1>The Number One Retirement Lie You’ve Been Told</h1>\n<p>If any of this resonates with you, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Freedom Begins the Day You Retire</h2>\n<p>Here's why that's not true and is a dangerous lie to be told. You delayed joy; you kept waiting for some day. Then you woke up on that some day and realized you were the same person with the same fears and the same habits, only now you didn't have the same amount of time.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Misunderstanding Money's Role</h2>\n<p>You had money throughout your life but were never taught how to spend it—only how to save it. Now, whether due to guilt or shame, you're struggling to figure out what role money actually plays in your life.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Losing Your Identity</h2>\n<p>You defined your entire identity around work and saving, only to wake up at 65 and have lost both overnight. Just a reminder of what Red said in <em>Shawshank Redemption</em>: \"That man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years. This is all he knows. In here, he's an important man. He's an educated man. Outside, he's nothing.\"</h2>\n\n<h2>4. Retirement is Not an Illusion of Freedom</h2>\n<p>I know we joke about work as a prison, but there's no greater analogy in retirement as an illusion of freedom that can quickly turn into a life without that same sense of structured purpose and identity. So, don't wait to live until that spreadsheet tells you you're allowed to do it. Start changing that script today.</p>",
