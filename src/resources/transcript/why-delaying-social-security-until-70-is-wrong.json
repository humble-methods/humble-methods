  "content": "<h1>Why Delaying Social Security Until 70 is the Wrong Choice</h1>\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I spend most of my time working on a new podcast, so if any of this is helpful, check it out by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Longevity Bias</h2>\n<p>Most traditional advice assumes we live well into our <strong>80s</strong>. And maybe we will, and maybe we won't. So I’d rather take my bird in the hand in my <strong>60s</strong> instead of two in the bush in my <strong>80s</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Compounding Memories</h2>\n<p>Traditional advice doesn’t account for the power of compounding memories. By taking benefits now, I have additional funds to enjoy life and create more experiences. I’ll get to enjoy those memories for an extra <strong>10 to 20 years</strong> instead of experiencing them in my <strong>80s</strong>, when, even if I'm alive, most of my friends probably won’t be.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Chasing the Green Light</h2>\n<p>As Gatsby taught us, the great danger is chasing that green light for too long. You can't repeat the past, old sport, but you can take what's yours now instead of waiting for some distant horizon that you might never see.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Enjoyment Over Deferral</h2>\n<p>No one should retire to continue deferring what you've already waited so long to enjoy. Make the most of your time and happiness now.</p>",
