Each year, I pay your 7-year-old brother $18,000 of tax-free income to work for me.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Uh, Dad, that is illegal?</p>\n<p><strong>Dad:</strong> No, it's taking advantage of small business deductions.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What's the catch?</p>\n<p><strong>Dad:</strong> The job has to be safe, he has to be paid fairly, and it has to be appropriate for his age.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> I thought the tax-free limit was $12,000 per child.</p>\n<p><strong>Dad:</strong> It is, but I put an additional $6,000 into an IRA for him.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> And he gets $18,000 tax-free?</p>\n<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Yup. And you get an $18,000 small business deduction?</p>\n<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Yup. Keeping it in the family. That's why it pays to know the tax code, son.</p>",
