  "content": "<h1>Why You Need to Talk to Your Aging Parents About Money Right Now</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. They Might Say They're Fine</h2>\n<p>When you ask about their finances, they might say they're fine. But that's often code for <strong>they're definitely not fine</strong>, and they just don't want to talk about it.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Approach with Curiosity</h2>\n<p>Approach the conversation with curiosity, not control. Ask them what they want their money to do if something happens, not whether they even have a plan. We’re not Dave Ramsey here, so there's no need to judge others and make them feel bad.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Don’t Wait for a Health Scare</h2>\n<p>Don’t wait for a health scare to have these discussions. Talk about things while they’re calm, because when a crisis hits, it’s too late to get important information like passwords or the power of attorney. </p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It might be awkward, yes. But I promise you, silence is way more expensive than discomfort.</p>",
