  "content": "<h1>Healthcare Coverage Considerations Before Medicare Kicks In for Early Retirement</h1>\n<p>If this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Explore Health Care Marketplace Options</h2>\n<p>Start by exploring health care marketplace options. Depending on your income, the <strong>ACA (Affordable Care Act)</strong> could help subsidize your plan and reduce premiums.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Consider COBRA Coverage</h2>\n<p>Consider <strong>COBRA</strong> coverage from your previous employer for up to <strong>18 months</strong>. However, keep in mind it's usually the most expensive option because you'll be paying the full premium on your own.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Ask Your Spouse to Keep Working</h2>\n<p>Ask your spouse to keep working, and just promise they'll get to watch <strong>Love is Blind</strong> every single night during TV time for at least a week. Two weeks. A month!</h2>\n\n<h2>4. Maximize Your Health Savings Account</h2>\n<p>If you're really planning on having a gap before turning <strong>65</strong>, do everything you can to gain access and contribute to a <strong>Health Savings Account (HSA)</strong> in your 40s and 50s. It's never too late, and that account is the equivalent of zero tax money as long as itâ€™s spent on qualified medical expenses.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you choose option 3, let me know how it goes!</p>",
