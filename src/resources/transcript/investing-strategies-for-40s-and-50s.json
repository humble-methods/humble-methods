  "content": "<h1>Investing in Your 40s and 50s</h1>\n<p>If I were investing $100,000 in my 40s or 50s, here are the only two things that I would consider. I\u2019m Tyler, I\u2019m a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. How Much Do I Want to Protect?</h2>\n<p>Meaning if the market hits the fan, and it will hit the fan, I don\u2019t wanna be a ding-a-ling and have to ever sell any of my assets at a deep discount. So what would I have invested in that would serve as a buffer asset and help supplement my income?</p>\n<p>I might put 20 to 40% of my assets in a combination of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Money market funds</li>\n    <li>CDs</li>\n    <li>Short-term treasuries</li>\n    <li>Long-term bonds</li>\n    <li>TIPS</li>\n    <li>Annuities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yep, even they serve a purpose from time to time. Anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you what they\u2019re selling.</p>\n\n<h2>2. How Much Do I Need to Continue to Grow?</h2>\n<p>Remember, it\u2019s not just about our immediate needs, but about our projected needs. This is the side of our portfolio that we will expect to grow at a rate of 7% to 10%. But because of that expectation, it will also take on more risk.</p>\n<p>Index funds, ETFs, blue-chip dividend funds, and real estate investment trusts can all help you put together this part of your portfolio.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Dividend Stock Funds</h2>\n<p>If it were really up to me and this were just my portfolio, I\u2019d truly take a close look at the dividend stock funds. Get a healthy return, relatively stable compared to an index fund, and you still own underlying assets that are meant to appreciate over time.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
