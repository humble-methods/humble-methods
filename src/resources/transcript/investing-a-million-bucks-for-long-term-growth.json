  "content": "<h1>How I Would Invest a Million Bucks for Long-Term Growth</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out this week's episode of the podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio. I'll go over this strategy in far more detail.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Total Stock Market or S&P 500 Fund</h2>\n<p>I’d allocate <strong>$400,000</strong> in a total stock market or S&P 500 fund for broad exposure, low fees, and the full upside of US equities.</p>\n\n<h2>2. International or Emerging Markets</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>$200,000</strong> in international or emerging markets. Yes, they're volatile, but long-term, global diversification can and has paid off. Currently, many of these are trading at a discount.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Tech and Innovation-Based ETFs</h2>\n<p>Next, I’d put <strong>$150,000</strong> into tech and innovation-based ETFs. Think semiconductors, AI, and cloud services. Higher risk? Yep. Huge growth potential if your time horizon is <strong>10+</strong> years.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Small Cap Stocks</h2>\n<p>Allocate <strong>$100,000</strong> in small cap stocks. They're often overlooked, but this is where some of the best long-term returns come from. A small cap index can help spread the risk.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Alternatives or Alts</h2>\n<p>The remaining <strong>$100,000</strong> would go into alternatives or alts, which could be private equity funds, venture ETFs, or even Bitcoin, if that's your thing. Just don't go overboard—try to keep these plays at 10% or less of your overall portfolio.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Cash</h2>\n<p>Finally, I’d have <strong>$50,000</strong> in cash. This isn't to play it safe; it’s for future opportunities. This portfolio is built for long-term capital appreciation, and you can expect a combination of growth and volatility.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio!</p>",
