Yes, I'd like to borrow <strong>$250,000</strong>.</p>\n<p>And why should we consider you for this loan?</p>\n<p>I'd like to go to college. You know, drink my face off for four years, go to <strong>25%</strong> of my classes, and get an <strong>English degree</strong>.</p>\n<p>Done!</p>\n\n<p>Hey, bank, could I also get that quarter of a million dollar loan?</p>\n<p>And what will you be investing in?</p>\n<p>I have this new, really incredible idea that could eliminate waste products from our environment forever.</p>\n<p>Sorry, it looks like you have <strong>zero proof of income</strong>, <strong>no credit history</strong>, <strong>no assets</strong> to secure the loan, <strong>no business experience</strong>, <strong>no formal business plan</strong>, <strong>no co-signer</strong>, <strong>no driver's license</strong>, <strong>no facial hair</strong>.</p>\n<p>Hey, you're just a kid.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I'm <strong>17</strong>.</p>\n<p>Yeah, we would never give you a quarter of a million dollars at <strong>5% interest</strong> and expect you to pay that back. Now, if you could please step aside.</p>",
