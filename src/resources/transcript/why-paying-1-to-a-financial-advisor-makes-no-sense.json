  "content": "<h1>Why Paying 1% to a Financial Advisor Makes No Sense</h1>\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I used to charge <strong>1%</strong>, and it made no sense.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Cost of Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>If you retire with <strong>$1 million</strong> and want to follow the <strong>4% withdrawal rule</strong>, you’ll take home <strong>$30,000</strong>, but your advisor takes home <strong>$10,000</strong> every year. That’s a significant slice of your income.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Long-Term Impact of Fees</h2>\n<p>Over <strong>30 years</strong>, that <strong>1%</strong> fee could cost you between <strong>25% and 30%</strong> of your total returns. That’s your hard-earned money vanishing into thin air!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Investment Similarity</h2>\n<p>The worst part? Most advisors invest you in the exact same index fund that you could buy yourself in under three minutes. That’s not advice; that’s an expensive subscription for handholding—very, very expensive handholding.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So if any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
