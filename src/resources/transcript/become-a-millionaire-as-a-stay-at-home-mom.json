  "content": "<h1>Become a Millionaire as a Stay-at-Home Mom: 3 Essential Steps</h1>\n<p>If you are a stay-at-home mom and want to become a millionaire before you're a leave-for-work partner, you need to do the following three things right now.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open Up a Roth IRA Today</h2>\n<p>You can do this through <strong>Fidelity</strong>, <strong>Schwab</strong>, <strong>E-Trade</strong>, <strong>Vanguard</strong>, <strong>Merrill</strong>, et cetera. It'll take you 10 minutes. Remember, if you open that Roth, you can take back those contributions at any time in case of emergency because you funded it with post-tax dollars.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest Weekly Into Your Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Put <strong>$50 to $100</strong> a week into that account. Invest that money into a low-cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500 or another major market index. Remember, while you're out of the workforce, you\u2019re not just losing out on your annual salary times the years out; you're missing out on a decade of compound growth.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Have a Re-Entry Plan Ready</h2>\n<p>Invest directly in yourself with countless <strong>online degree programs and courses</strong> that can better situate you to re-enter the market at a higher market value. This will also indicate to potential employers that you've been absolutely crushing it while being a stay-at-home mom.</p>",
