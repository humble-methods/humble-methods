  "content": "<h1>How to Strategically Retire in Your 60s</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Calculate Your Number</h2>\n<p>Start by calculating your retirement number. This means taking your annual spending and multiplying it by <strong>20</strong>. For example, if you need <strong>$80,000</strong> a year, you're aiming for <strong>$1.6 million</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Adjust for Taxes</h2>\n<p>Now multiply that number by <strong>1.15</strong>. Why? Because the number you just came up with—what most financial advisors tell you is the magic number—is actually pre-tax. In retirement, you won't magically evade taxes, meaning you're now aiming for <strong>$1.84 million</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Prepare for the Unexpected</h2>\n<p>Next, multiply by another <strong>1.15</strong>. Why? Because everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. You'll get punched, and it's important to prepare for that reality.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Max Out Your 401k</h2>\n<p>Now max out your <strong>401k</strong>. If you're over <strong>50</strong>, you benefit from a catch-up contribution of <strong>$7,000</strong> a year. That means <strong>$2.1 million</strong> isn’t as far out of reach as you might have imagined.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Conduct a Spending Audit</h2>\n<p>Finally, run a spending audit to cut future liabilities now. Redirect every dollar from this point forward to your future plan. This proactive approach will ensure you’re on track for a secure retirement.</p>",
