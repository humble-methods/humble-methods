  "content": "<h1>How Big Banks Profit from Target Date Retirement Funds</h1>\n<p>Here\u2019s how big banks are making millions of dollars a year by convincing you that you can\u2019t do basic algebra. If even one dime of your money is invested in a <strong>target date retirement fund</strong> through your <strong>401(k)</strong> or <strong>403(b)</strong>, you\u2019ll want to stick around to hear this.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Simple Math</h2>\n<p>I want you to take <strong>110</strong> and subtract your age. Got the number? Can you do that math? I thought so. But big banks have done a genius job of convincing you that you can't.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Understanding Target Date Funds</h2>\n<p>A target date retirement fund does nothing more than shift your money around once a year, ensuring that <strong>110 minus your age</strong> is invested in equities (stocks) while the remainder is invested in fixed income (bonds).</p>\n\n<h2>3. Your Power to Make Changes</h2>\n<p>So, if you can subtract your age from <strong>110</strong>, which we\u2019ve established you can, and you can set aside <strong>10 to 15 minutes a year</strong> to adjust your investments between Fund X and Fund Y, it\u2019s time to ask yourself why you're giving up tens of thousands of dollars in fees towards your retirement dreams.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Taking Back Control</h2>\n<p>By allowing these banks to treat us like two-year-olds who can\u2019t do basic algebra, we end up funneling that money directly into their pockets. Don\u2019t let them profit off your inaction\u2014take control of your financial future!</p>\n\n<p>If you found this information helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
