  "content": "<h1>The Hidden Tax Advantages of Taxable Brokerage Accounts</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Long-Term Capital Gains Rates</h2>\n<p>When you hold an investment for more than a year, you'll pay only <strong>0%</strong>, <strong>15%</strong>, or <strong>20%</strong> on your gains, depending on your income level. Compare this to the potential <strong>37%</strong> ordinary income rate that could apply to your 401(k) withdrawals. This is a significant saving opportunity!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Step-Up Basis for Your Heirs</h2>\n<p>When you pass away, your heirs inherit your taxable brokerage account at its current market value. This means all of those decades of gains you worked hard to build practically disappear. They can sell off those assets the next day and pay <strong>zero</strong> in taxes. In contrast, any inherited traditional IRAs come with ordinary income tax on every withdrawal your kids have to make in 10 years.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Tax Loss Harvesting</h2>\n<p>If one of your investments drops, you can sell it and book the loss, allowing you to offset any amount of gains or up to <strong>$3,000</strong> of ordinary income per year. Even better, your losses roll forward indefinitely! This is a strategy you simply can't execute in a 401(k) or an IRA.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Stop treating your taxable brokerage account like a consolation prize and start taking it as seriously as I take <strong>Selling Sunset</strong>. And that's very seriously. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
