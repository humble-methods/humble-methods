Now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Missing Days Affects Returns</h2>\n<p>If you missed just the 10 best trading days in the last 25 years, your return dropped from 9.9% to 5.6% a year.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Trying to Time the Market is Risky</h2>\n<p>Missed the 30 best days, and you just made less than a savings account.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Close Call with the Best and Worst Days</h2>\n<p>For all you folks who are still waiting on the sidelines because we're due for a crash, six of the best trading days ever happened within two weeks of the worst ones.</p>\n\n<p>So just remember, 10 years from now, odds are you'll wish you'd been invested for the past decade instead of sitting on the sidelines experiencing early retirement FOMO.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
