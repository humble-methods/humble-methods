  "content": "<h1>The Biggest Investing Lie You've Ever Been Told</h1>\n<p>Here is the biggest investing lie you have ever been told: that you aren’t smart enough to invest money on your own. So let’s see if you are by taking a quick quiz.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Short-Term Goals</h2>\n<p>Do you know how much money you need right now or in the near future to accomplish your short-term goals? If you thought about that, then great! That money should go to a <strong>high-yield savings account</strong> or a <strong>money market fund</strong> where it’s safe but can still earn <strong>10 times</strong> the national average on a traditional savings account.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Long-Term Goals</h2>\n<p>Now, do you know how much you can afford to set aside for your long-term goals? Excellent! Now you can open a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> or a <strong>taxable brokerage account</strong>. Fund those accounts with that money and invest in a <strong>low-cost index fund</strong> or ETF.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Simplicity in Investing</h2>\n<p>If someone ever tells you that investing needs to be more complicated than that, odds are they're selling you something that will detract from both your short-term and long-term goals to fund their own.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter in my bio, and every Sunday morning, I’ll send over some insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
