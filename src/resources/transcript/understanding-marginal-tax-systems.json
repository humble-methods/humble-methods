Do you owe us? <strong>$57,626</strong>.</p> <p>Oh, no, <strong>$10,000</strong> of that was a holiday bonus.</p> <p>Yep, and that bonus bumped you up to the <strong>32% tax bracket</strong>.</p> <p>Sucker.</p> <p>Uh, that's not how taxes work.</p> <p>Oh, we know how taxes work.</p> <p>I don't think you do.</p> <p><strong>32%</strong> only applies to my income that is over <strong>$170,050</strong>. That's how a marginal tax system works.</p> <p>Yeah, I know. Do you?</p> <p>So instead of <strong>$57,000</strong>, you just owe us <strong>$37,000</strong>?</p> <p>Well, we haven't even talked about deductions yet, but it looks like this might be all you can handle for one day.</p>",
