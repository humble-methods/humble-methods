  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $2 Million for Retirement to Generate Over $100,000 in Dividends</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and today I'm sharing exactly how I would invest $2 million for retirement to achieve over $100,000 a year from dividends alone. My goal is to provide financial insights so you don\u2019t have to pay for them.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in Dividend Funds</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, I would allocate 90% of my assets across four dividend funds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>XSHD's Small Cap ETF</li>\n<li>GlobalX's Super Dividend ETF</li>\n<li>Invesco's High Dividend ETF</li>\n<li>Invesco's Equity REIT (real estate investment trust) - specifically setting aside $450,000 for this investment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These funds currently average a <strong>6.8% annual return</strong>, which would gross me about <strong>$123,000 a year</strong>. I'm also optimistic that the underlying assets will continue to appreciate over time.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Maintain Cash Reserves</h2>\n<p>The remaining <strong>$200,000</strong> would be kept in cash, invested in a money market fund that offers about <strong>5% return</strong>. This strategy not only mitigates the risk of poor early market returns but also provides me with a relatively stable additional <strong>$10,000 a year</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Optimize Social Security Benefits</h2>\n<p>Finally, once I reach the age of <strong>70</strong>, I would take full advantage of my social security benefits, which, as of today, would be approximately <strong>$48,000 a year pre-tax</strong>. I would also encourage you to evaluate your projected benefits at ages 62, 66, and 70 to help with your financial planning.</p>\n<p>Utilizing these strategies can bring you one step closer to your retirement goals and ensure you maintain financial freedom.</p>",
