  "content": "<h1>Smart Financial Power Moves to Save You Thousands Annually</h1>\n<p>Here is a quick financial power move that will save you thousands of dollars annually. And you're not gonna like it. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager who now creates financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>Five Ways This Move Saved Me Money</h2>\n<p>Before I tell you this money-saving move, here are the five ways in which this one move alone has saved me about $2,648 this year. But who's counting?</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>I took my monthly phone bill from $89.99 a month to $39.99 a month.</li>\n  <li>I knocked a $349 round trip ticket to Miami down to $156.</li>\n  <li>I reduced my car payment from $500 a month to $400 a month.</li>\n  <li>I took my satellite radio subscription from $14 a month to one year for free.</li>\n  <li>I increased my rate of return on a CD over the next 90 days from 2.5% to 4.5%.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How You Can Do It Too</h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s how you can do the exact same thing: right after you watch this video, call every single company with which you\u2019re currently doing business\u2014credit card companies, banks, and subscription services. Tell them you\u2019re sick and tired of their prices and you\u2019re going to take your business elsewhere.</p>\n<p>They will immediately offer you a better deal. When they do, say no. Most likely they'll then offer you an even better deal. Again, say no. Ultimately, they will provide you with what is known as their first degree discriminatory pricing, offering you their best and lowest deal because they know it\u2019s more costly for them to lose you as a customer than to give you a steep discount.</p>\n<p>This process might be uncomfortable, but it will make you a stronger negotiator and a more confident consumer. You can take that $2,500 you save and invest it directly into a Roth IRA in low-cost index funds, helping you become a millionaire by retirement.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
