  "content": "<h1>Understanding the Financial Iceberg of the Holidays</h1>\n<p>The holidays are like a financial iceberg. The part you see is the gifts, but the part you don’t see is everything else: travel, groceries, decorating, time off work. The holidays have a convenient way of stretching your wallet in every direction, whether you planned on it or not.</p>\n\n<h2>1.
