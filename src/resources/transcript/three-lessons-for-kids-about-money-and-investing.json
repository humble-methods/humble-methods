  "content": "<h1>Three Vital Lessons on Money and Investing to Teach Your Child</h1>\n<p>If I could teach my child only three things about money and investing, here's what I would teach them.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Delay Gratification</h2>\n<p>Number one, I would teach them to <strong>delay their gratification</strong>. Every single dollar they spend at 10 years old is equivalent to $30 at retirement. I know, this might be a tough one to teach a 10-year-old, but I'm gonna try.</p>\n<h2>2. Understand the True Cost</h2>\n<p>Number two, understanding the <strong>true cost</strong> of something. An item in a store doesn't just cost what's on the price tag; it also costs you whatever experience you forfeited because you spent that money. So the cost of going to that baseball game, it's not just the ticket, the popcorn, the soda; it's also the cost of seven hours of your life that you could have spent on literally anything that you could dream up.</p>\n<h2>3. The Importance of Low-Cost Investing</h2>\n<p>And number three, I would teach them that <strong>nine is less than ten</strong>. If my child learns to invest in low-cost index funds on their own, they might get an average 10% return throughout their lifetime. But if my child gives that money to a financial advisor and has that advisor invest in those same funds, well now my child will get a 9% return on average for the rest of their lives. And over a 50-year investing timeline, that's the difference between setting my child up for <strong>generational wealth</strong> and setting their advisor up for generational wealth.</p>\n<p>And if any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you and your child one step closer to where they need to be.</p>",
