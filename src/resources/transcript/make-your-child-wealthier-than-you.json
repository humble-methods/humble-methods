  "content": "<h1>How to Make Your Child Wealthier Than You: Easy Steps to Build Generational Wealth</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in a UGMA Account</h2>\n<p>Invest <strong>$50 a week</strong> in a UGMA. This is a custodial brokerage account for minors. That's <strong>$2,600</strong> a year. Invest it in a growth fund like Vanguard's VUG, which has historically returned <strong>10 to 12%</strong> post-inflation. If you do this from birth to age 18 and then stop, by age 65, your child will have <strong>$8.7 million</strong> with only a total investment of <strong>$47,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Fund a Custodial Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Have your kid work for your business and legally pay them <strong>$7,000</strong> a year. They should put it all in VUG as well. If you do this from age 10 to 18 and then stop contributing, by age 65, they will have <strong>$4.2 million</strong>—and it’s all <strong>100% tax-free</strong> with a total investment of <strong>$56,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Continue Contributions to the Custodial Roth</h2>\n<p>If they keep contributing to the same custodial Roth IRA from age 18 to 65 and max it out every year with another <strong>$7,000</strong>, they could end up with <strong>$18.3 million</strong> by age 65, also <strong>100% tax-free</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Your Role in This</h2>\n<p>That's generational wealth, all for helping your child shred some paper and continuing good investment habits as they get older. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
