  "content": "<h1>Four Effective Ways to Invest $10,000 Cash for Maximum Growth</h1>\n<p>Here are four things you could do right now with $10,000 of cash. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, now making financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Traditional Savings Account</h2>\n<p>Put it in a traditional savings account. Have it lose about 3% of its value a year and have the purchasing power of <strong>$4,010</strong> in 30 years.</p>\n\n<h2>2. High Yield Savings Account</h2>\n<p>Put it in a high yield savings account. Have it earn about 4 or 5% a year, minus the 3% inflation, minus another 25% or so on taxes on the interest, resulting in a net gain of about <strong>1 to 1.5%</strong>, and have the purchasing power of <strong>$15,630</strong> in 30 years.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Put it in a brokerage account. Invest it in a low-cost index fund like Vanguard's VOO. Potentially appreciate <strong>7%</strong> per year and, so long as held for over one year, pay about <strong>15%</strong> taxes on the capital gains, resulting in the purchasing power of <strong>$56,204</strong> in 30 years.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Put it in a Roth IRA. Invest it in a low-cost index fund like Vanguard's VOO. Potentially appreciate <strong>7%</strong> per year and, so long as you hold it past <strong>59 1/2 years</strong> old, pay zero taxes on any and all gains, resulting in the purchasing power of <strong>$76,122</strong> in 30 years.</p>\n\n<p>The choice is yours. Just know it's a <strong>$72,000</strong> choice.</p>",
