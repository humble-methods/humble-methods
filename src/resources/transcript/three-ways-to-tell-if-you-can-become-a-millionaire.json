  "content": "<h1>Three Key Indicators You Have What It Takes to Become a Millionaire</h1>\n<p>Do you believe you actually have what it takes to become a millionaire? Here are three ways to tell if you actually do.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Are You Willing to Sacrifice?</h2>\n<p>And I don't mean the daily latte. I mean are you willing to give up spending 50 to 100 bucks a week for the next 10 years so you can actually take advantage of <strong>compound interest</strong>?</p>\n\n<h2>2. Can You Stop Trying to Show Off?</h2>\n<p>Can you stop trying so damn hard to show the entire world how much money you have? Remember, <strong>wealth</strong> is always and forever what you don't see. If you're spending it, you're not investing it.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Are You Willing to Stop Consuming and Start Creating?</h2>\n<p>Again, I'm not talking about the avocado toast. I mean are you willing to give up two hours of consuming social media or streaming services each day and devote that time instead to <strong>creating</strong>? If you start creating today, I promise you will have another income stream within six months.</p>\n\n<p>It's completely okay if you don't want to commit to those three things. It's not easy. But just don't wake up 10 years from now and wonder why you still don't have a million bucks in your pocket when the answers were right in front of you the entire time.</p>",
