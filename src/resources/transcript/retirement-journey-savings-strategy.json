  "content": "<h1>How I Built a Million-Dollar IRA on a $60,000 Salary</h1>\n<p>Yep. Looks like you'll be retiring with just over <strong>a million dollars</strong> in your IRA.</p>\n<p>Yep. It says here you only made <strong>$60,000 a year</strong> throughout your life.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I didn't make that much, but I loved what I did. So, how did you invest enough to reach a million dollars at retirement?</p>\n<p>I protected as much of what I made as I could. Since I was <strong>30</strong>, I've been putting <strong>10%</strong> of whatever I made directly into my <strong>401(k)</strong>. I learned to live on less as early as possible.</p>\n<p>I got all my clothes from Target. Nobody can tell.</p>\n<p>You took advantage of our accounts?</p>\n<p>That and I follow Social Cat. They make complex finance seem easy.</p>",
