Now I create financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The World Owes You Nothing</h2>\n<p>The world owes you nothing—<strong>zero</strong>. It doesn’t care about your feelings.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Stop the Victim Mindset</h2>\n<p>So, stop the victim mindset because no one’s gonna pay you to complain.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Solve Big Problems</h2>\n<p>Start solving big problems for big clients. If you actually solve their problems, you can charge them whatever you want. This empowers you financially.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Avoid Random Advice</h2>\n<p>Stop taking advice from random ding-dongs online. If they haven’t built anything, they’re just gonna take your money, and the joke’s on you. Remember, a fool and his money are soon parted.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you more thoughts like this to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
