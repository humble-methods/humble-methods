  "content": "<h1>How I Would Invest $1 Million If I Were in My 40s or 50s</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Establish My Core</h2>\n<p>I'd start by investing <strong>$500,000</strong> in an <strong>S&P 500 fund</strong> like <strong>VOO</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in Growth</h2>\n<p>Next, I’d allocate <strong>$200,000</strong> in a <strong>growth fund</strong> like <strong>VUG</strong>. It’s a very cheap fund with a slightly heavier weighting towards tech.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Consider Private Equity</h2>\n<p>I’d invest <strong>$200,000</strong> in a <strong>private equity fund</strong>. This option has slightly higher costs, much less transparency, very little regulation, and much longer potential lock-up periods for your money. I’d usually have to be an accredited investor, but this is a way to take advantage of potentially higher risk-adjusted returns.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Individual Stocks for Personal Goals</h2>\n<p>Finally, I’d invest <strong>$100,000</strong> in individual stocks. Not to try to beat the market per se, but to tilt my portfolio to align with my values and personal goals. Even if just a few of these hit, the returns can be immense. However, I would never do this with more than <strong>10%</strong> of my investable assets because the most important thing in investing is always being able to play another day.</p>",
