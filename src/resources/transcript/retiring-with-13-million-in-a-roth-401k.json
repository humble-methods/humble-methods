You see, this is a <strong>Roth 401(k)</strong>.</p>\n<p>So?</p>\n<p>So contribution limits are <strong>$23,000</strong> a year, and I just maxed it out each year.</p>\n<p>But even that only adds up to <strong>$23,000</strong> times <strong>40</strong>... that\u2019s <strong>$920,000</strong>.</p>\n<p>Ah, you're not taking into account the <strong>eighth wonder of the world</strong>.</p>\n<p>Zach Morris?</p>\n<p>No. <strong>Compound interest</strong>.</p>\n<p>I contributed <strong>$920,000</strong> to that account and then sat back, read some books, and just watched it grow. And grow. And grow.</p>\n<p>So you didn't even have to work for <strong>$12 million</strong> of this money?</p>\n<p>Oh, I don't work for my money. <strong>My money works for me.</strong></p>",
