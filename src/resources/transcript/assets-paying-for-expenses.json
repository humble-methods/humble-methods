I don\u2019t pay for anything I buy.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s called stealing.</p>\n<p>Oh no, my <strong>assets</strong> pay for everything.</p>\n\n<h2>Example: Costco Membership</h2>\n<p>Can you give me an example?</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you want a <strong>premium membership</strong> to Costco for life. Ooh, hot dogs!</p>\n<p>You need <strong>$120</strong> a year. We know that <strong>Walmart</strong> pays a <strong>1.71%</strong> annual dividend. So if we save <strong>$7,000</strong>, invest that money, you get <strong>$120</strong> a year just in dividends.</p>\n<p>Wouldn\u2019t I have just used that <strong>$7,000</strong> on a Costco membership for life?</p>\n<p>This way, you get the Costco membership, and you still own <strong>$7,000</strong> worth of stock. It\u2019s the double dip.</p>\n\n<h2>Learning Opportunity</h2>\n<p>You\u2019re learning, son. Follow <strong>SocialCat</strong>. He makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
