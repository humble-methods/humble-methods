  "content": "<h1>3 Essential Financial Steps for Women in Their 20s to Achieve Millionaire Status</h1>\n<p>If you are a woman in your twenties and you want to be a millionaire before that finance bro sitting next to you, then you need to do the following three things right now.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Start by opening a <strong>brokerage account</strong> and put <strong>$3.47</strong> a day into that account. What is a brokerage account? It\u2019s like a fancy savings account that you can open in about five minutes through platforms like <strong>Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, E-Trade,</strong> or <strong>Robinhood</strong>. It doesn't cost anything to open, and you never have to use it if you don't want to. Unlike a savings account where your money just sits in cash earning big <strong>zero percent</strong>, a brokerage account gives you the option to invest your money.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest That Money</h2>\n<p>Now, investing can feel overwhelming, and I\u2019ll never tell you exactly what to invest in because I don\u2019t know you or your goals. However, I encourage you to take <strong>15 minutes today</strong> and ask ChatGPT these three questions:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>What is a low-cost index fund?</li>\n    <li>What is a three-stock portfolio?</li>\n    <li>What is a target date retirement fund?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>3. Pay Off High-Interest Debt First</h2>\n<p>Only invest if you have your <strong>high-interest debt</strong> already taken care of. The stock market has historically returned around <strong>7% to 8%</strong> on your investment. However, if you're paying between <strong>18% to 20%</strong> to credit card companies, you\u2019re losing a lot of money until that high debt is managed. So, direct that <strong>$3.47</strong> a day towards paying off your credit card debt. Remember, we have to learn to walk before we can learn to run.</p>\n\n<p>If you find this information helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep sharing insights to help you achieve your financial goals.</p>",
