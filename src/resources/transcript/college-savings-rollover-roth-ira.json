You're not mad that you contributed all that money to the 529 college savings plan and now I don't want to use it for college?</p> <p>No, I'll just roll that money over into your Roth IRA.</p> <p>I don't think you can do that without being penalized 10%.</p> <p>Oh yes you can, starting in 2024. What's the catch?</p> <p>The rollover's capped at $35,000, annual contribution limits still apply, and the account has to have been open for 15 years.</p> <p>I just learned something new. It's almost like we don't even need to spend a quarter of a million dollars to send you to college anymore.</p>",
