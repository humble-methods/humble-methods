  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $10,000 While Learning About Tilting Your Portfolio</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Core Investment in Low-Cost Index Funds</h2>\n<p>I’d invest <strong>$7,000</strong> in a low-cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500, like <strong>Vanguard's VOO</strong>. This would provide exposure to some of the world’s most successful companies, serving as my core holding through good times and bad.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Small-Cap Growth Exposure</h2>\n<p>Then, I’d invest <strong>$1,500</strong> in a small-cap growth fund like <strong>Vanguard's VBK</strong>. With this investment, I would own shares in smaller companies that are higher risk but have the potential for higher rewards. Many might fail, but some will make it, and I got in earlier.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Value Fund for Stability</h2>\n<p>For the remaining <strong>$1,500</strong>, I’d invest in a value fund, like <strong>Fidelity's FVAL</strong>. This fund invests in companies that may not be the most fashionable choices right now, but possess strong balance sheets and potential upside, often trading at a discount.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Investment Accounts to Use</h2>\n<p>This type of investment can be made in a <strong>401k</strong>, <strong>Roth IRA</strong>, or <strong>taxable brokerage</strong> account, depending on your goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my <strong>free weekly newsletter</strong> by clicking the link in my bio, and each week, I will send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
