  "content": "<h1>How to Write Off a One-Week Trip to Sedona, Arizona</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 1: Set Up a Consulting Package</h2>\n<p>First, I would <strong>set up a one-on-one consulting package</strong> with a client who lived in Arizona.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 2: Fly to Arizona</h2>\n<p>Next, I would fly to Arizona and meet with that client at <strong>10 a.m. each day for coffee</strong>. Afterward, I would take them out to lunch, ensuring that I spend the early afternoon <strong>addressing their financial needs</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 3: Document Everything</h2>\n<p>I would diligently document all of my conversations and meals with the client. These interactions would be <strong>for business purposes, ordinary and customary</strong> within my financial consulting industry, and aimed at growing my own business.</p>\n\n<h2>Benefits</h2>\n<p>By following these steps, I would be able to write off expenses such as <strong>airfare, hotel, meals</strong> with the client, and <strong>car rental</strong>. Moreover, I would genuinely enjoy collaborating face-to-face with a client on intellectual and financial challenges. This premium service would also provide me with additional income.</p>\n\n<h2>Afternoon Free Time</h2>\n<p>And at <strong>3 p.m. each day</strong>? I would have the rest of the afternoon and early evening to explore Sedona, Arizona, while having paid for my trip using tax-free money. If any of this is helpful, <strong>like and follow</strong>, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
