  "content": "<h1>3 Immediate Financial Steps to Take When Your Child is Born</h1>\n<p>When your child is born, you need to do the following three things immediately:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Pay for Photos</h2>\n<p>Pay them <strong>$12,000 a year</strong> to be in photos on your family business's website. This not only acknowledges their role in the family business but also starts building a financial foundation.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Open a Custodial Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Open a <strong>custodial Roth IRA</strong> for them and contribute <strong>$6,500</strong> to it annually. This will allow their money to grow tax-free, giving them a significant advantage in building wealth for their future.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Add Them as an Authorized User</h2>\n<p>Enlist them as an <strong>authorized user</strong> on your credit card. They\u2019ll likely have an impressive <strong>800 credit score</strong> by the time they're <strong>18</strong>, leading to better rates on loans and credit in the future.</p>\n\n<p>All of these actions can ensure your child has <strong>$500,000</strong> by the time they reach adulthood, simply for smiling at the camera and saying cheese. If that doesn\u2019t teach them about how money works in this country, I don\u2019t know what will.</p>",
