  "content": "<h1>Three Proven Cheat Codes to Retire Early with Financial Freedom</h1>\n\n<p>Here are three cheat codes to retire early with way more money in your pocket. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Stop Relying Solely on Earned Income</h2>\n<p>You have to work the hardest for it and it's taxed the highest. You need to commit to learning about <strong>portfolio income</strong> and <strong>passive income</strong> and do everything in your power to start generating one additional stream of income.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Understand Good Debt vs. Bad Debt</h2>\n<p>Stop believing that all debt is bad debt. <strong>Good debt</strong> buys appreciating assets that generate positive cash flow, while <strong>bad debt</strong> buys depreciating assets that generate no cash flow.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Start Your Own Business or Get Involved in Real Estate</h2>\n<p>Do everything you can to start your own business or to get involved with real estate investing. The tax code was literally written to reward <strong>business</strong> and <strong>development</strong>. If you're not taking advantage of either, you're missing the top two ways to retire early with more money in your pocket.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
