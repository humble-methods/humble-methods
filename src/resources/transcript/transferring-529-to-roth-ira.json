As long as the 529 has been open for at least <strong>15 years</strong>, I can transfer up to <strong>$35,000</strong> into the Roth IRA.</p>\n<p>Well, she can't touch that $35,000 until she's <strong>59 and a half</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is a Roth IRA. She can access the contributions whenever she wants for whatever she wants.</p>\n<p>So we get nothing.</p>",
