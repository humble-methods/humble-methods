  "content": "<h1>3 Books That Taught Me More Than My MBA</h1>\n<p>Here are three books that taught me more than my <strong>MBA</strong>. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you maximize your success.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The 4-Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss</h2>\n<p>My number one takeaway from this book is: stop spending life checking emails and allowing other people's agendas to become your daily to-do list. Focus on what truly matters to you and eliminate distractions.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Shoe Dog by Phil Knight</h2>\n<p>From this book, my biggest lesson is to <strong>fail quickly</strong>. You can have an idea, but you will never know if it's good or bad until that idea meets a real customer. Trust the process of evaluation through action.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Irrational Loyalty by Deb Gabor</h2>\n<p>This book taught me that if you want to build a personal brand and establish authority in your field, give away every piece of knowledge and value you have for one year. Hereâ€™s the punchline: do it for <strong>free</strong>. No courses, no paywalls, no subscription service nonsense for VIP access only. All free, all year. This approach will ensure you never have to worry about money or authority again.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter, where every Sunday morning, I'll continue to share insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
