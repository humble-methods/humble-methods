  "content": "<h1>What You Need to Know About Living Off Dividends</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Average Dividend Yield</h2>\n<p>The average dividend yield on the S&P 500 is around <strong>1.5%</strong>. If you want to live off <strong>$75,000</strong> a year in dividends, you're looking at needing a <strong>$5 million portfolio</strong>, and that's pre-tax.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Risks of Chasing High Yields</h2>\n<p>Chasing high yields usually means taking on more risk. Think <strong>junk bonds</strong>—it’s not magic.</p>\n\n<h2>3. A Smarter Strategy</h2>\n<p>A smarter way might involve using dividends, strategic withdrawals, and possibly a part-time income stream that doesn’t make you want to fake your own death. You can definitely live off your portfolio, but if you’re chasing dividends alone, bring a calculator, and probably a side hustle, along with a willingness to live off of broccoli!</p>",
