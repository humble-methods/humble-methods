  "content": "<h1>Why You\u2019re Paying $12,797 in Taxes While I Pay Zero</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly why you are paying <strong>$12,797</strong> in taxes this year, and why I'm paying <strong>zero</strong> in taxes this year. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free so that you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding Your Tax Situation</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s say that you and your partner are <strong>W-2 employees</strong>, and you earned roughly <strong>$100,000</strong> this year. You both worked <strong>40 hours a week</strong> and <strong>50 out of 52 weeks</strong> of the year. After the standard deduction of <strong>$29,200</strong>, you\u2019re left reporting <strong>$70,800</strong> of taxable income to the U.S. government.</p>\n<p>From that, <strong>$4,389</strong> goes directly to Social Security, <strong>$1,026</strong> goes directly to Medicare, and <strong>$7,382</strong> goes directly to the federal government in the form of income taxes. Assuming you live in Florida, you owe <strong>$0</strong> in state income tax. You\u2019re left with a take-home pay of <strong>$87,203</strong>, and you\u2019ve just paid <strong>$12,797</strong> in taxes.</p>\n\n<h2>My Tax Strategy</h2>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s say my partner and I also made <strong>$100,000</strong> this year. After the standard deduction of <strong>$29,200</strong>, we were also left with <strong>$70,800</strong> in taxable income. But instead of paying <strong>$4,389</strong> in Social Security, <strong>$1,026</strong> in Medicare, and <strong>$7,382</strong> to the federal government, we pay <strong>nothing</strong>. Why?</p>\n<p>Because each year we sell <strong>5%</strong> of our <strong>$2 million</strong> stock portfolio, and we live off of that <strong>$100,000</strong>. This <strong>$100,000</strong> is considered <strong>capital gains income</strong>, as opposed to your labor income.</p>\n<p>We owe <strong>0%</strong> in Social Security, <strong>0%</strong> in Medicare, and <strong>0%</strong> to the federal government because it's under <strong>$80,000</strong>. Oh yeah, and we also moved to Florida, so we pay <strong>$0</strong> in state income tax.</p>",
