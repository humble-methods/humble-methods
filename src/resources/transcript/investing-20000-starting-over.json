  "content": "<h1>How I Would Invest $20,000 If I Were Starting Over</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in an S&P 500 Index Fund</h2>\n<p>I’d put <strong>$8,000</strong> into an index fund that tracks the <strong>S&P 500</strong>, like Fidelity's <strong>FXAIX</strong>. It’s cheap and holds <strong>500</strong> of the world’s biggest and most profitable companies, including <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Broadcom</strong>, and <strong>Meta</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in Growth or Tech Fund</h2>\n<p>Next, I’d invest <strong>$6,000</strong> into a growth or tech-heavy fund like <strong>QQQM</strong>. Once again, it’s cheap and holds more of the companies likely to take off based on AI and technology.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in International Stocks</h2>\n<p>Then, I’d invest <strong>$4,000</strong> into an international stock ETF, like Vanguard's <strong>VXUS</strong>. The US is great, but history shows us that no one country's economy is going to win forever.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Keep Cash for Liquidity</h2>\n<p>Finally, I’d keep <strong>$2,000</strong> in a money market fund, like Fidelity's <strong>SPAXX</strong>. It’s currently earning around <strong>4%</strong> and invests in safe, reliable, short-term government securities like T-bills, providing immediate liquidity and relative safety.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
