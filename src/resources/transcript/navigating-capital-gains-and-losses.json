You owe us.</p>\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<p>Gains from stocks are taxed at your normal income rate or at capital gains rates.</p>\n<p>Yes, they are. But I also locked in <strong>$250,000</strong> of losses on other stocks because the market is down this year.</p>\n<p>But it says here you still own those identical stocks.</p>\n<p>No, it says I own <strong>similar stocks</strong>.</p>\n<p>Similar?</p>\n<p>Yep. You see, by selling one stock, I lock in that loss on paper. Then, I immediately re-buy a very similar stock to stay <strong>100% invested</strong> in the market.</p>\n<p>But you have to wait <strong>30 days</strong> to do that.</p>\n<p>That's only if I re-buy the identical stock.</p>\n<p>And you re-bought similar stocks.</p>\n<p>And we get nothing.</p>",
