  "content": "<h1>Why You Should Never Lock All Your Wealth into One Thing</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Your House is Not an ATM</h2>\n<p>Your home is not a financial plan or an ATM. Relying too heavily on it can lead to financial troubles down the line.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Challenges of Private Investments</h2>\n<p>Private investments might feel elite until you try to sell and hear nothing but crickets. Liquidity can be a real concern in these cases.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Evolving Goals</h2>\n<p>People evolve; your goals will change, and your money needs to keep up. <strong>Liquidity means freedom</strong>. And freedom is usually better than those new granite countertops you bought to impress people you never have over.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
