  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $2 Million at Age 70 for Income and Stability</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Investing Strategy</h2>\n<p>Here's exactly how I'd invest $2 million at age 70 if I wanted more income and less growth.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Invest in SCHD</h3>\n<p>I'd start by putting <strong>$1.2 million</strong> in SCHD. This is Schwab's US Dividend Equity ETF, which focuses on stable, dividend-centric companies. This provides lower expected growth but additional income, acting as my new paycheck at 70.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Invest in BND</h3>\n<p>Next, I would allocate <strong>$600,000</strong> into BND, Vanguard's Total Bond Market ETF. This will give me stability when stocks drop, serving as my safety net during market downturns.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Invest in a Money Market Fund</h3>\n<p>The remaining <strong>$200,000</strong> would go into a money market fund like Fidelity's SPAXX for liquidity and peace of mind. This is my \"buy-the-dip\" fund for being 70 years old, even if I still believe timing the market is a bad idea.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Annual Withdrawals</h3>\n<p>I would withdraw <strong>6%</strong> annually from SCHD, roughly <strong>$72,000</strong> per year. I'd make sure to sell monthly, as markets tend to be higher by year's end.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Total Annual Income</h3>\n<p>This would give me approximately <strong>$40,000</strong> a year from the SCHD dividend yield, <strong>$18,000</strong> a year from bond interest, another <strong>$8,000</strong> a year from money market yield, plus <strong>$30,000</strong> from Social Security, providing a total annual income of about <strong>$168,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This plan works for most of us who aren't looking for growth after 70.
