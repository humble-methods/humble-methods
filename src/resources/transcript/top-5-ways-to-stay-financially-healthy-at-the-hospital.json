Most insurance companies will charge an additional cost beyond your coverage. Consider getting a roommate \u2013 make a new friend!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Number 4:</strong> You'll most likely be asked to sign a document that states you will pay all costs, even if they're not covered by your insurance. Make it clear in writing that you will accept those charges as long as the services are provided by in-network providers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Number 3:</strong> Make sure you know if you're being admitted to the hospital as inpatient or outpatient/observation status. These costs can keep you on observation status for up to three days, and these costs are typically much higher.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Number 2:</strong> If somebody visits your room or bed, ask who they are and why they're there. Take notes. If you're not well enough to do so, make sure you're with someone who is. These costs can add up quickly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finally, Number 1:</strong> Make sure you know what you\u2019re being charged for any take-home equipment or supplies. You don\u2019t want to wind up paying $1,000 for a bandage and a sling that you could have gotten at CVS for $10.</p>\n\n<p>Stay healthy,<em> TikTok</em>.</p>",
