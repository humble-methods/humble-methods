  "content": "<h1>The 3 Biggest Financial Mistakes You Can Make</h1>\n<p>Remember, there are only three mistakes you can make with your money. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free so you don\u2019t make mistakes with your money.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Paying High Fees for Low Returns</h2>\n<p>The first mistake is giving your money to a <strong>financial advisor</strong> who charges <strong>1%</strong> of your assets as a fee while putting your money in a low-cost index fund. You might be better off handling these investments yourself.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Trusting Active Management</h2>\n<p>The second mistake is giving your money to a financial advisor who charges you <strong>1%</strong> of your assets to pick stocks with the promise of beating the stock market, despite the fact that <strong>90%</strong> of active managers can't and don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s crucial to be aware of the odds you\u2019re up against.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Not Investing Time in Financial Education</h2>\n<p>The third mistake is not committing <strong>10 hours</strong> of your life over the next few months to learn about <strong>low-cost index funds</strong>, <strong>compound interest</strong>, and <strong>dollar-cost averaging</strong>. If you learn these concepts, you\u2019ll avoid making the first two mistakes altogether.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
