  "content": "<h1>The Truth About the 4% Rule: What You Really Need to Know for Retirement</h1>\n<p>If you think you can only withdraw <strong>4%</strong> of your money per year in retirement, you've been lied to. Here’s the truth.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The 4% Rule Origin</h2>\n<p>The <strong>4% rule</strong> is based on the <em>Trinity Study</em>, conducted by three professors from Texas. They showed you could safely withdraw <strong>4%</strong> of your principal and almost never run out of money.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Median Ending Value</h2>\n<p>However, the study also found that the median ending value of a <strong>$1 million</strong> hypothetical portfolio with a <strong>4%</strong> annual drawdown was valued at <strong>$10 million</strong> after <strong>30 years</strong>, assuming it was <strong>100%</strong> invested in stocks.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Mixed Investments</h2>\n<p>Additionally, it found that the median value of the same hypothetical million-dollar portfolio with the same <strong>4%</strong> annual drawdown was valued at <strong>$6 million</strong> after <strong>30 years</strong>, invested <strong>75%</strong> in stocks and <strong>25%</strong> in bonds.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Higher Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>Finally, the study concluded that you could withdraw <strong>7%</strong> of your principal annually and have a <strong>96%</strong> chance of never running out of money, as long as you were <strong>100%</strong> invested in stocks.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So what's the takeaway? Yes, you can withdraw <strong>4%</strong> of your principal annually in retirement, and the odds are you'll be safe. And yes, you can withdraw <strong>7%</strong> of your portfolio in retirement, and the odds are you’ll be safe. Isn’t it nice to know you only need about half of what you’ve been told you need to retire?</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.
