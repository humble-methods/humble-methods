Market as a Storm</h2>\n<p>The market isn't a puzzle to solve. It’s a storm to endure. Understanding this fundamental truth can help you approach investing with the right mindset.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Competing Against Machines</h2>\n<p>You’re not competing with your neighbor. You’re competing with billion-dollar machines trained by people who eat spreadsheets for breakfast. Yep, they do!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Even the Pros Get It Wrong</h2>\n<p>Even the pros get it wrong, a lot. They’ve got <strong>Bloomberg terminals</strong> and yachts, while you have Robinhood updates and a guy named <strong>CryptoMike234</strong> on Reddit.</p>\n\n<h2>4. The Real Goal: Ownership</h2>\n<p>Stop trying to win. Just try to own. Buy a total stock market fund and go for a walk. It’s that simple.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
