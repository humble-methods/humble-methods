  "content": "<h1>The 3 Essential Rules of Wealth Building</h1>\n<p>Here are the only three rules of wealth building you will ever need. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free so you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Start Today</h2>\n<p>If you start investing in your <strong>20s</strong>, it takes about <strong>$10 a day</strong> to be a millionaire by retirement. If you wait until your <strong>50s</strong>, you\u2019re looking at around <strong>$1,900 a day</strong>. I\u2019ll take the 20s!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Stay Consistent</h2>\n<p>I invest the exact same percentage of my income into the markets each and every month. As I get paid more, I naturally invest more without having to think about it, which keeps my investment habit consistent.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Ignore the Noise</h2>\n<p>Over the long term, markets go up. When that changes, don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll let you know. Focus on your long-term strategy rather than short-term fluctuations.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
