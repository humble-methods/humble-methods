So what?</p> <p>So nobody's gonna spend a thousand bucks today to get a bond paying 2% when they could spend that same thousand bucks and get a bond paying 5%.</p> <p>But why did it drop in price?</p> <p>Because if you sell that bond today and it's only returning 2%, then you have to make up for the difference between that 2% and what investors think they could get elsewhere. So you would have to sell your current bond at a discount.</p> <p>So I've lost money?</p> <p>No, you can hold the bond you have right now until maturity and get the thousand dollars back plus the 2% return. That never changes.</p> <p>But if you wanna sell the bond today, you need to give the buyer an additional incentive to do so beyond the 2%.</p> <p>Oh, that makes sense.</p> <p>Really? Well, no, but you tried your best.</p>",
