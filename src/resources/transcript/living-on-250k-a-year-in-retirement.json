  "content": "<h1>How to Spend $250,000 a Year in Retirement with $2 Million</h1>\n<p>If I retired with <strong>$2 million</strong> and wanted to spend a quarter of a million dollars a year, here\u2019s exactly what I would do. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you understand your retirement options.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest for Growth</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s say I retired at <strong>65</strong> and anticipated living until <strong>83</strong>. That gives me <strong>18 years</strong> to fund my retirement. I would invest <strong>75%</strong> of my assets across three equity funds: <strong>VOO</strong>, <strong>QQQM</strong>, and <strong>SCHD</strong>. This investment mix would offer me about a <strong>7%</strong> annual appreciation after inflation.</p>\n<p>I would draw down about <strong>$150,000</strong> a year from selling stocks and gross an additional <strong>$22,350</strong> from the dividends of <strong>SCHD</strong> and <strong>VOO</strong>. Yes, I acknowledge that this dividend return would diminish over time.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in Bonds</h2>\n<p>I would then invest <strong>15%</strong> of my assets in <strong>five- and ten-year government bonds</strong>, generating another <strong>$12,000</strong> a year.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Keep Cash Reserves</h2>\n<p>I would hold <strong>$200,000</strong> in cash on the sidelines. If the market takes a hit in the early years of my retirement, I wouldn\u2019t have to sell my full <strong>$150,000</strong> worth of stocks; I could use some of that cash to supplement my income if needed.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Leverage Social Security</h2>\n<p>Finally, at <strong>70 years old</strong>, I would start living even more extravagantly as I cash in on my full benefits of <strong>Social Security</strong>, which is projected to be about <strong>$48,000</strong> a year.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>And that, my friends, is how I would live off of close to <strong>$250,000</strong> a year in retirement and aim to officially die with <strong>zero</strong>.</p>",
