Now, I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it. If I were investing my first $10,000 in my 20s, here is exactly what I would do:</p>\n\n<h2>Step 1: Establish Your Core</h2>\n<p>I would allocate <strong>$8,000</strong> directly to a low-cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500. This establishes a solid foundation for my investment portfolio.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 2: Invest in Growth</h2>\n<p>Next, I'd invest <strong>$1,000</strong> in a growth fund that aligns with my personal values and preferences. For instance, I like tech, but you might prefer crypto or energy. Just be sure to avoid paying load fees and ensure the expense ratio is below <strong>0.05%</strong>. If it\u2019s not, you are probably overpaying for the service.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 3: Explore Individual Equities</h2>\n<p>Lastly, I would invest the remaining <strong>$1,000</strong> across <strong>10 individual stocks</strong>. This decision is deliberate for a couple of reasons: to gain firsthand experience of market fluctuations and to understand my own risk tolerance during stock market downturns. Being in my 20s gives me the time to recover from any mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>With <strong>80%</strong> of my investment in a core strategy, I have a stable foundation. Additionally, if I get lucky and pick a few winning stocks, I won't owe any capital gains taxes on those profits.</p>\n\n<h2>Utilizing a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Importantly, I would conduct all this investing within a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>, which is a no-brainer for tax advantages.</p>\n\n<p>If you found this information helpful, like and follow, and I\u2019ll continue to share insights to help guide you toward financial success.</p>",
