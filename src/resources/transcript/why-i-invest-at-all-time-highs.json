  "content": "<h1>Why I Still Invest, Even When the Market is at an All-Time High</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Historical Performance</h2>\n<p>Since 1980, whenever the market's P-E ratio was above 20, considered too expensive, the average five-year return was still an impressive 75%.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Below 20 Valuations</h2>\n<p>Conversely, when valuations were below 20, average returns were 83%. Barely a noticeable difference.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Bubble Fallacy</h2>\n<p>The \"it's-over-valued\" crowd has been shouting about a bubble since Reagan was in office. Meanwhile, those who remained invested in the market made 14 times their initial investment.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So stop waiting for perfect valuations; they simply don't exist. But do keep an eye out for regret, as that arrives much quicker. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my <strong>free weekly newsletter</strong> by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
