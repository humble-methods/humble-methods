  "content": "<h1>Key Financial Takeaways from Kamala Harris's Latest Financial Disclosure</h1>\n<p>Kamala Harris just recently disclosed her financials publicly. Here are the four key takeaways for us.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Low-Cost Investments</h2>\n<p>She\u2019s most likely not gaming the system like some other politicians we all know and don't trust, as she holds eight low-cost, mostly passively managed index funds across her 457B and her other defined benefit plans.</p>\n<h2>2. Overlapping Funds</h2>\n<p>Although she's well diversified across these eight funds, she and her husband hold way too many funds that overlap with one another. There's no reason to hold multiple funds to track the S&P 500.</p>\n<h2>3. Cash Reserves</h2>\n<p>She is very smart to have about $850,000 sitting in cash on the sidelines. This will allow her to invest more heavily in index funds if and when the stock market corrects, and it will serve as a healthy three to six month emergency fund if she finds herself without a job in the next three to six months.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: This is an apolitical channel. That was purely a financial statement.</em></p>\n<h2>4. Side Hustle Success</h2>\n<p>She even was smart enough to create her own side hustle back in 2019 by publishing a children's book. Now she takes home an additional $8,000 a year gross. Might not be a ton of money, but hey, when someone can make $8,000 a year by sitting on their couch or talking about people falling out of coconut trees, that's a win in my financial playbook.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
