  "content": "<h1>Understanding the Importance of Investment Costs</h1>\n<p>If I could only teach you one thing about investing, it would be that cost matters way more than your annual return. And here is exactly why.</p>\n<h2>Who Am I?</h2>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, now dedicated to creating valuable financial content for free, so you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>Cost Comparison: Investor One vs. Investor Two</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Investor One:</strong> Pays a financial advisor 1%. Additionally, without knowing, they incur about 1% in commissions to get into fancy mutual funds, along with another 1% fee just to be in those mutual funds. They also face a 0.5% portfolio turnover fee due to active management throughout the year, and a cash drag of 0.15% because the advisor is waiting for the right time to enter the market. This sums up to a total fee of <strong>3.65% annually</strong>, regardless of performance.</li>\n  <li><strong>Investor Two:</strong> This investor has been following my channel and knows how to invest in low-cost index funds that track their desired indexes for just <strong>0.02% annually</strong>. They incur no commission fees, no turnover fees, and no cash drag because they understand that timing the market isn\u2019t as critical as spending time in the market.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>The Results After 30 Years</h2>\n<p>After 30 years of investing, Investor One's initial <strong>$100,000</strong> has grown to a healthy <strong>$661,000</strong>, whereas Investor Two's initial <strong>$100,000</strong> has dramatically increased to over <strong>$1.65 million</strong>. That million-dollar difference went somewhere\u2014too bad it wasn\u2019t to Investor One.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep trying to guide you one step closer to financial success.</p>",
