  "content": "<h1>Here's How I Would Invest $10,000 in 2024</h1> <p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p> <h2>Step 1: Open a Roth IRA</h2> <p>First, I would start by opening a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> through <em>Fidelity</em>, <em>Schwab</em>, or <em>Vanguard</em>.</p> <h2>Step 2: Fund the Roth IRA</h2> <p>Next, I would fund that Roth IRA with <strong>$5,000 a year</strong> over the next two years. I wouldn't be able to put it all in at once because the current annual limit for someone my age is <strong>$7,000</strong>.</p> <h2>Step 3: Invest in an Aggressive Growth Fund</h2> <p>Once funded, I would invest that $10,000 into an <strong>aggressive growth fund</strong> like <em>Vanguard's VIGAX</em>. With a <strong>10% annual return</strong>, that $10,000 initial investment could grow to over <strong>$158,000</strong> over the next 30 years.</p> <h2>Tax Benefits of a Roth IRA</h2> <p>Importantly, I wouldn't owe one penny of taxes on that <strong>$148,000</strong> of capital gains because I was smart enough to invest in a Roth IRA.</p> <p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
