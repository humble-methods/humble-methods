  "content": "<h1>How I'd Invest $2 Million at Age 65 for a Worry-Free Retirement</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in VOO</h2>\n<p>Start by putting $1.8 million into VOO, Vanguard's S&P 500 fund. This is a low-cost, diversified investment across many businesses, and I would expect a 7% real return over time.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Stability with SPAXX</h2>\n<p>The remaining $200,000 would go into Fidelity's money market fund, SPAXX. T-bills provide stability and liquidity—a crucial 'shock absorber' needed at age 65.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Withdrawal Strategy</h2>\n<p>I would begin by withdrawing 4% a year from the VOO, which equates to about $72,000 a year. However, I’d sell 0.33% monthly instead of all at once annually, since markets tend to be higher at the end of the year than at the beginning.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Combine Income Sources</h2>\n<p>From the money market, I'd expect to yield about $8,000 a year. Coupled with another $25,000 a year from the VOO dividends and $30,000 from Social Security—which is the national average for higher earners—my total annual income would come to about $135,000.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Lifestyle Benefits</h2>\n<p>That's more than enough for daily walks in the woods, coffee on the porch, and even the occasional spending spree at Filson.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my <strong>free weekly newsletter</strong> by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
