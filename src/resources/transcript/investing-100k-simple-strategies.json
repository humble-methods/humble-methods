  "content": "<h1>Investing $100,000: Simple Strategies for Financial Success</h1>\n<p>If I were to invest $100,000 of your money, here are the three things that I would do with it.</p>\n\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Investment Strategies</h2>\n<p>Number one, I would put 70 to 90% of that money directly into a low-cost index fund. The exact percentage would depend on your age, your short and long-term goals, and your appetite for risk.</p>\n\n<p>Number two, I would put the remaining 10 to 30% in a low-cost total bond fund. Again, the exact percentage would depend on your age, your short and long-term goals, and your appetite for risk.</p>\n\n<p>Number three, I would then take you out for a cup of coffee and teach you the following formula: <strong>110 minus your age equals the percentage of your total portfolio that is typically allocated to a low-cost index fund</strong>, with the remainder being allocated to the total bond fund.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>I would tell you to spend 15 minutes a year rebalancing your portfolio to reflect that equation. And I would charge you nothing for my time because learning to do this yourself brings me way more joy than anything I have found in life that money can buy.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
