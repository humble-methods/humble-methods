  "content": "<h1>How to Fund Healthcare Costs Effectively While Managing Social Security Benefits</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Anticipate Out-of-Pocket Expenses</h2>\n<p>Even with <strong>Medicare</strong>, retirees face surprise out-of-pocket costs, including premiums, deductibles, and copayments. For example, the 2025 Medicare Part B deductible is <strong>$257</strong>. Thatâ€™s the price of at least a dozen eggs you can no longer afford!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Consider Supplemental Insurance</h2>\n<p><strong>Supplemental insurance</strong> (or Medigap policies) can help cover expenses that Medicare doesn't cover, such as deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. This reduces out-of-pocket expenses and provides some financial predictability. That might be <em>meta-helpful</em> to you!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Leverage Health Savings Accounts</h2>\n<p>I talk about this one a lot! If you have access to a <strong>Health Savings Account (HSA)</strong> now, it's the only triple-tax-advantaged account in the world. Maxing it out early and often will help cover any gap in healthcare coverage for you and your loved ones.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
