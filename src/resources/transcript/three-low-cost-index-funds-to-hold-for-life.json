  "content": "<h1>Three Low-Cost Index Funds and ETFs to Buy and Hold for Life</h1>\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. VUG - Vanguard's Growth ETF</h2>\n<p>This fund includes top five holdings like <strong>NVIDIA</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong>, and <strong>Broadcom</strong>. And it's offered at one fourth the price of Invesco's QQQM, which holds the same tech giants.</p>\n\n<h2>2. VTI - Vanguard's Total Stock Market ETF</h2>\n<p>For just <strong>0.03%</strong> annually, this ETF gives you access to every publicly traded company in the US. It can’t really be beat as your core holding.</p>\n\n<h2>3. SCHD - Schwab's Dividend Equity ETF</h2>\n<p>This fund focuses on companies that not only pay dividends but also grow those dividends over consecutive years. It's great for those seeking income while still holding stocks expected to appreciate over time. With a <strong>0.06%</strong> annual cost, it’s also hard to beat.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
