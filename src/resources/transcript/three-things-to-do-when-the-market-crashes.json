  "content": "<h1>3 Things to Do Instead of Panicking When the Market Crashes</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. When in Doubt, Zoom Out</h2>\n<p>The dumbest thing we've ever done is normalize looking at the stock market daily when we're not day traders. If my investment plan is a <strong>20-year plan</strong>, what happens today or tomorrow is officially irrelevant.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Reassess Your Risk Tolerance, Not Your Portfolio</h2>\n<p>If you are freaking out and tempted to sell, know that it's not a complete loss; you've just bought yourself some timeless and priceless information. You weren't invested appropriately, and your theoretical risk tolerance is not the same as your practical risk tolerance.</p>\n\n<h2>3. You Haven't Lost Money</h2>\n<p>Remember, you haven't lost money. That's not how investing works. You own the exact same piece of the pie that you did yesterday; the entire pie is just smaller now. But the good news is, over time, the entire pie has only gotten bigger. So if you don't sell, you haven't lost a dime!</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
