  "content": "<h1>Understanding Mortgage Payments</h1>\n<p>Before you even put one penny towards paying down that mortgage early, you need to understand this one thing first. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Switch to Bi-Weekly Payments</h2>\n<p>Number one, you could switch your mortgage payments from monthly to bi-weekly. Now instead of 12 monthly payments, you're paying 26 half payments. For a $300,000 house with a 4.25% 30-year fixed rate mortgage, you'd save $45,000 in interest and cut 5 years off the life of the loan.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Additional 10% Payments</h2>\n<p>Number two, consider putting an additional 10% towards paying down your mortgage each month. This option would save you $50,000 in interest and also cut the loan by 5 years.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Additional 20% Payments</h2>\n<p>Number three, if you put an additional 20% towards paying that mortgage every single month, you'd save $80,000 in interest and reduce the loan term by 8 years.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Learn About Interest</h2>\n<p>But number four, take just 20 minutes today to teach yourself the difference between simple linear interest and compound interest. Understanding this concept is crucial; if you are really just looking for more money, you could invest any of the money saved from options 1, 2, or 3 into a low-cost index fund. Over the next 30 years, you could earn about 3 or 4 times what you'd save in interest.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
