If any of this is helpful, check out this week's episode of the podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, where we’ll go over this in even more depth and nuance.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Write a Simple Thank You Note</h2>\n<p>Start by writing to them and saying, <em>“Thank you for your time. I've simply decided to move in a different direction with my financial planning.”</em></p>\n\n<h2>2. Keep It Simple</h2>\n<p>That’s it! Don’t let whatever guilt they put on you cost you another <strong>$5,000 to $10,000</strong> bucks a year.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Remember, It’s Your Money</h2>\n<p>Always remember, <strong>it is your money</strong>. It’s not a bad prom date that you’re trying not to hurt.</p>",
