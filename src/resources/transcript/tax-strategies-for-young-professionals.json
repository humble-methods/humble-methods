  "content": "<h1>Essential Tax Strategies for Young Professionals</h1>\n<p>If I were in my 20s or 30s, here is exactly how I would avoid paying taxes on about 42% of my income. Legally.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Maximize Your 401(k)</h2>\n<p>Let's assume I make $90,000 a year. I would put $23,000 into a 401(k) and try to get the employer match. No brainer. Anyone who tells you not to is selling you insurance.</p>\n<h2>2. Invest in a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Next, I'd put $7,000 in a Roth IRA and invest it aggressively. There is an income cap to contribute to these, so do it while you can and do it while you're young and in a super low tax bracket.</p>\n<h2>3. Utilize Health Savings Accounts</h2>\n<p>If I had a high deductible health plan, I would max out my Health Savings Account (HSA) with $4,300. I\u2019d invest it in low-cost index funds, and trust me, your future sick self will say thank you.</p>\n<h2>4. Take Advantage of Deductions</h2>\n<p>Then I'd turn around and take the $15,000 single filer deduction, telling the government I only made $47,700. This would allow me to go from the 22% to the 12% tax bracket.</p>\n<h2>5. Think Long-Term</h2>\n<p>At this rate, I will most likely become a millionaire in just over 15 years. In the words of Ferris Bueller, life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop to look around once in a while, you might just miss it.</p>",
