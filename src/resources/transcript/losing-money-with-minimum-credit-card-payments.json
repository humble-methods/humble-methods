It looks like you've already put a lot on your credit card today.</p>\n<p><em>Relax, I always pay the minimum every single month.</em> In fact, the credit card company just called me and told me I'm their favorite customer. They even increased my credit limit.</p>\n<p>Oh, brother.</p>\n<p>What? Of course they told you you were their favorite customer. You're giving them <strong>20% returns</strong> every single month just by paying the minimum.</p>\n<p><strong>But I make the payments on time, every month. I don't pay interest if I do that, right?</strong></p>\n<p>Wrong. By only paying the minimum every month, you're paying <strong>20% to the credit card company</strong> on the entire balance.</p>\n<p>If you followed Social Cap, you'd know to only use credit cards if you can pay down the entire balance.</p>\n<p><strong>Well, why do they keep increasing my credit limit?</strong></p>\n<p>They want you to increase that balance. 20% of a bigger balance is a bigger paycheck for the credit card company.</p>\n<p><strong>Okay, well, doesn't it at least help my credit score?</strong></p>\n<p>Looks like we have some work to do.
