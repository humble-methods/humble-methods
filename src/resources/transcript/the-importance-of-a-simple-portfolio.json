  "content": "<h1>Why You Need to Build a Simple Portfolio and Rebalance Once a Year</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Complexity is Often a Mask for Boredom</h2>\n<p>Complexity looks smart, but usually, it means you're just bored and overthinking your investments.</p>\n\n<h2>2. A Few Funds Cover the Spectrum</h2>\n<p>Just three to five funds can cover the entire world of investments. This approach avoids clutter and cocktail party bravado.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Rebalance Once a Year</h2>\n<p>Pick a date—your birthday, New Year, or any holiday—and rebalance once a year. If your portfolio needs weekly check-ins, it's not investing; it's a need for control disguised as productivity.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
