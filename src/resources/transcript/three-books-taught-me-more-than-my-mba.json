  "content": "<h1>3 Books That Taught Me More Than My MBA</h1>\n<p>Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Tim Ferriss' <em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em></h2>\n<p><strong>Number one takeaway:</strong> Stop spending life checking email and allowing other people's agendas to become your daily to-do list.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Phil Knight's <em>Shoe Dog</em></h2>\n<p><strong>Number one takeaway:</strong> Fail quickly. You have an idea, and you will never know if it's a good idea or a bad idea, no matter how smart you think you are, until that idea meets a real customer.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Deb Gabor's <em>Irrational Loyalty</em></h2>\n<p><strong>Number one takeaway:</strong> If you want to build a personal brand and establish authority in your field, give away every single piece of knowledge and value you have for one year. Here\u2019s the punchline: for free. No courses, no paywalls, no subscription service nonsense for VIP access only. All free, all year.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll never have to worry about money or authority again. And if any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter where every Sunday morning, I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
