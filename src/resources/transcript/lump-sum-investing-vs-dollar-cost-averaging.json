  "content": "<h1>Should You Invest All at Once or Little by Little? Key Insights</h1>\n<p>If you have <strong>$1,000</strong> to invest, and you want to know whether to invest it all at once or a little at a time, here are the three things you need to know.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Lump Sum Investing Advantage</h2>\n<p>If you invest it all at once—known as <strong>lump sum investing</strong>—a recent <strong>Vanguard study</strong> found that this strategy has outperformed investing gradually <strong>68%</strong> of the time.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Dollar Cost Averaging Benefits</h2>\n<p>If you opt for investing little by little, known as <strong>dollar cost averaging</strong>, this strategy has outperformed having your money sit in cash <strong>69%</strong> of the time.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Performance vs. Cash</h2>\n<p>And remember, if you invest it all at once, lump sum investing has outperformed cash <strong>70%</strong> of the time.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Emotions vs. Numbers</h2>\n<p>But the numbers might tell one story while our emotions tell another. We don’t always act in our best interest. If you know you sleep better at night hedging your bets to avoid one big loss, then dollar cost averaging might be better for you.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Cash Is Not King</h2>\n<p>If you’re someone who doesn’t want to invest at all, then you can continue to call your cash king. But remember, don’t say I didn’t warn you!</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I’ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
