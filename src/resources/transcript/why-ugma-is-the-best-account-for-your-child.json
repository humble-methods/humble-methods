  "content": "<h1>3 Reasons Why the UGMA is the Best Account for Your Child\u2019s Future</h1>\n<p>Here are three reasons why the <strong>UGMA</strong> (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) is the only account I would ever open for your child if your only goal was to make them a millionaire. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you understand your investment options.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Unlimited Contributions</h2>\n<p>Unlike custodial Roth IRAs and <strong>529 plans</strong>, there are no limits on your contributions to a UGMA account. You could fund that account with <strong>$17,000</strong> at your child's birth, avoid any federal gift tax, and invest it in low-cost index funds. Your child would most likely become a millionaire by age <strong>43</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. No Contribution Restrictions</h2>\n<p>There are no restrictions on contributions, meaning you don\u2019t have to own a small business and hire your child as an employee, worrying about being audited for paying them for using their likeness and image in one of your social media campaigns.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Flexibility in Spending</h2>\n<p>Finally, there are no restrictions on how your child spends the money. If your child decides that a liberal arts degree isn't worth a quarter of a million dollars, they have the flexibility to go to <strong>VoTech</strong>, learn something practical, start their own business, or even purchase their first house in cash by age <strong>21</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
