  "content": "<h1>How to Set Up $3 Million for Lifelong Payoff</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. $2 Million in Custom-Built Dividend Portfolio</h2>\n<p>This would consist of about 30 stocks spread across sectors such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples. This approach limits business risk while collecting 3-4% annually. Plus, I wouldn’t have to pay a company to manage the funds for me.</p>\n\n<h2>2. $500,000 in a Blue-Chip Dividend ETF or Index Fund</h2>\n<p>Investing this amount in funds like SCHD, VIG, or DGRO provides additional exposure to high-quality dividend growers that might not be in my custom portfolio. It also serves as a benchmark, allowing me to compare my portfolio's performance against professional funds.</p>\n\n<h2>3. $300,000 in Broad Index Fund</h2>\n<p>I would allocate $300,000 to a fund like VTI because, even in retirement, I need growth, not just dividends, to   outpace inflation.</p>\n\n<h2>4. $200,000 in Money Market Fund</h2>\n<p>This will go into a fund like SPAXX or SGOV, which pays around 4-5% and provides a buffer against inevitable market volatility.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, this strategy would generate around $120,000 in interest and dividends annually. Plus, I could always sell a small slice of the VTI each year for a little extra cash.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
