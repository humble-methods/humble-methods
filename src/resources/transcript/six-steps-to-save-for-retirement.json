  "content": "<h1>6 Steps to Ensure You Have Enough Money Saved for Retirement</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Start with Core Spending</h2>\n<p>Consider your essential expenses like housing, food, travel, and healthcare. Let's say that's <strong>$60,000</strong> a year.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Add a 15% Cushion</h2>\n<p>Add a <strong>15%</strong> cushion for variables like market drops, long-term care, and taxes. Now you're targeting <strong>$69,000</strong> a year.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Multiply by 20</h2>\n<p>Multiply that number by <strong>20</strong> if you're comfortable living on <strong>5%</strong> of your assets a year in retirement. We're up to <strong>$1.38 million</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Factor in Guaranteed Income</h2>\n<p>Now factor in any guaranteed income you might have, like <strong>Social Security</strong>. For me, that might be <strong>$24,000</strong> a year, which considers <strong>$480,000</strong> covered.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Set a New Target</h2>\n<p>Your new target is now between <strong>$900,000</strong> and <strong>$1 million</strong> of investable assets.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Adjust for Your Personal Goals</h2>\n<p>Finally, adjust for your own personal goals. Thereâ€™s never a one-size-fits-all. Do you want to leave money behind, or do you want to spend it all? Remember, perfect is the enemy of the good. A good plan, like the one we just went over, is all you really need.</p>",
