  "content": "<h1>5 Essential Steps to Take with Your Paycheck Before It Hits Your Bank Account</h1>\n<p>Before that paycheck even hits your bank account, here are the five things that you need to do with it. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you make informed financial decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. High-Yield Savings Account</h2>\n<p>Put <strong>20%</strong> of it directly into a <strong>high-yield savings account</strong>. This account is for my <strong>one to five year goals</strong> and allows my money to work for me, earning up to <strong>50 times</strong> the national average on savings accounts. You can open one today through <strong>Ally, SoFi,</strong> or <strong>UFB Direct</strong>. These accounts are both <strong>FDIC insured</strong> and highly accessible in case of an emergency.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Taxable Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Put <strong>10%</strong> of it directly into a <strong>taxable brokerage account</strong>. This account is for my <strong>five to 20 year goals</strong>. You can open one through <strong>Fidelity, Vanguard,</strong> or <strong>Schwab</strong> and invest the money in a no-cost index fund like Fidelity's <strong>FNILX</strong>. As long as you hold onto those investments for over one year, you will receive a tax advantage and pay less on those future capital gains.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Retirement Accounts</h2>\n<p>Put <strong>10%</strong> of that paycheck directly into a <strong>401(k)</strong>, <strong>Roth IRA</strong>, or <strong>Roth 401(k)</strong>. This account is for my <strong>20 to 30 year goals</strong>. You can invest that money into a relatively aggressive fund like Invesco's <strong>QQQ</strong> or Vanguard's <strong>VUG</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Health Savings Account (HSA)</h2>\n<p>Put <strong>5%</strong> directly into a <strong>health savings account</strong> if you have access to one. This is the only <strong>triple advantage tax account</strong> in the world. Contributions are tax-deductible, investments grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals are tax-free as long as they're spent on qualifying medical expenses. You don\u2019t need to do this through your employer; you just need a high-deductible health plan, no other health insurance, and a minimum deductible of <strong>$1,600</strong> for individuals or <strong>$3,200</strong> for families.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Budget for Immediate Bills</h2>\n<p>The remaining <strong>55%</strong> of your paycheck is for your immediate bills and should be put in a <strong>checking account</strong>. If you truly cannot afford your basic necessities on <strong>55%</strong> of your paycheck, start by lowering your contributions to the taxable brokerage account, followed by the high-yield savings account, then the 401(k) or Roth IRA, and finally the health savings account.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
