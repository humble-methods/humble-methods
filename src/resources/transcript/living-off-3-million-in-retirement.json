  "content": "<h1>How to Live Off of $3 Million in Retirement Without Running Out of Money</h1>\n<p>Here's exactly how I would live off of $3 million in retirement and never run out of money. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in a Low-Cost ETF</h2>\n<p>Start by investing <strong>$2 million</strong> in Vanguard's ETF, <strong>VOO</strong>. Not only would I now be invested in the world's most profitable and stable companies, but I would also receive around <strong>$23,000 a year</strong> in dividends alone.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Blue Chip Dividend Fund</h2>\n<p>Next, invest <strong>$700,000</strong> in a blue chip dividend fund like Schwab's <strong>SCHD</strong>. This fund would mitigate some volatility of the VOO and would also provide around <strong>$28,000</strong> in dividends alone.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Money Market Fund for Liquidity</h2>\n<p>Finally, invest the remaining <strong>$300,000</strong> in a money market fund like Fidelity's <strong>SPAXX</strong>. This fund invests in short-term, low-risk government securities like T-bills, providing liquidity, stability, and about <strong>$12,000</strong> a year in interest alone.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Withdrawal Strategy</h2>\n<p>But I don't want to live on <strong>$63,000 a year</strong>. So each year, I would sell <strong>6%</strong> of my VOO investments, sold strategically at <strong>0.5% per month</strong> to dollar-cost average out of the index. This approach helps manage the volatility.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Projected Growth</h2>\n<p>With expectations that VOO would grow on average at <strong>7%</strong> in real terms, I could continue this plan indefinitely without ever needing to touch the principal investment.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>And with that, I'd have enough to dress my bloodhounds in <strong>Orvis gear</strong> for the rest of their lives. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
