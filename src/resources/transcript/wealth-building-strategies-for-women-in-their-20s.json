  "content": "<h1>3 Wealth-Building Strategies for Women in Their 20s</h1>\n<p>If you are a woman in your 20s and want to become a millionaire before that guy sitting next to you, you need to do the following three things right now.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Decrease Your Taxable Income</h2>\n<p>Make it your ultimate priority to decrease your taxable income by <strong>15% to 20%</strong> per pay period. You can achieve this by maxing out your contributions to <strong>401(k)s</strong>, <strong>403(b)s</strong>, and <strong>traditional IRAs</strong>. On average, women earn less than men, making it even more crucial to protect what you do make. I know, it might seem tough.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest Consistently</h2>\n<p>Invest <strong>$25 to $50</strong> a week into a <strong>taxable brokerage account</strong>. You can do this through platforms like <strong>Fidelity, Schwab,</strong> or <strong>Vanguard</strong>. While it might not seem like a tax-advantaged account, it actually is. When you invest in the stock market and sell those stocks for a profit, those gains are taxed at a lower rate than your normal income tax rate. This is a common tactic used by millionaires.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Create an LLC for Your Side Hustle</h2>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t already created an <strong>LLC</strong> for your side hustle, it\u2019s time to hustle over to your Secretary of State's website and make that happen. This opens up a world of <strong>tax write-offs</strong>. The more you invest in your business, the more you can take advantage of these write-offs, allowing your business and your net worth to grow and grow.</p>\n\n<p>Taking these steps will set you on the path to financial empowerment and millionaire status!</p>",
