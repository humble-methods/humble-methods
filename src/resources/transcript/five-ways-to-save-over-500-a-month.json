  "content": "<h1>Five Effective Strategies to Save Over $500 Monthly</h1>\n<p>Here are five more ways that I'm able to save over $500 a month in order to max out my Roth IRA each year. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Cut Out Travel Expenses</h2>\n<p>I do not spend money on travel. With the average millennial budgeting close to $5,000 annually for travel, I find just as much joy exploring something new each day on my local trail. In the wise words of Seneca, \"Why do you wonder that globe-trotting does not help you, seeing that you always take yourself with you?\"</p>\n\n<h2>2. Avoid Luxury Cars</h2>\n<p>I do not spend money on fancy cars. Don't get me wrong; I used to. Then I realized it was a massive waste of money. With luxury leases running upwards of $600 a month, I opted for a Subaru Outback. Being from New England, I will drive that car into the ground, well past 250,000 miles on lovely backwoods roads.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Keep Wedding Costs Low</h2>\n<p>I didn't spend any money on my wedding. I wanted to, but then COVID hit. The silver lining was that we couldn't have the wedding we envisioned. Instead, we got married on a beach in Maine for free. This way, instead of spending $40,000 on a two-day event where we wouldn't even get to see each other, we confidently invested in our first house with that money.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Limit Phone Expenses</h2>\n<p>I don't spend money on the latest iPhone or phone plan. The only thing I really want my phone to do is screen calls, so I don't have to engage in unnecessary conversations.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Focus on Content Creation</h2>\n<p>I do not spend time consuming media; I devote that time to creating my own. Commit to spending 30 minutes today writing your first blog post, making your first video, writing a song, or drafting your dream business plan. Life is too long to do nothing and too short to do something. So get rolling!</p>\n\n<p>And if any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
