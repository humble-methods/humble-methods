  "content": "<h1>Creating an Aggressive Growth Portfolio for Maximum Capital Appreciation</h1>\n<p>If you want to grow your portfolio as quickly as possible, this aggressive growth portfolio is designed for investors who seek maximum capital appreciation and can handle market swings. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to guide your investment choices.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Large Cap Growth Stocks</h2>\n<p>Invest <strong>50%</strong> in US large-cap growth stocks; this will be the core of your portfolio. You could go with the <strong>Vanguard Growth Index Fund</strong>, <strong>VIGAX</strong>, for low-cost exposure to big-name companies like <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, and <strong>Amazon</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Small Cap Stocks</h2>\n<p>Allocate <strong>20%</strong> to US small cap stocks. Small companies typically have much more room to grow. Consider using the <strong>iShares Russell 2000 ETF</strong>, <strong>IWM</strong>, to capture that upside potential.</p>\n\n<h2>3. International Stocks</h2>\n<p>Finally, put <strong>30%</strong> into international stocks. This way, you spread your risk beyond the US with funds like the <strong>Vanguard FTSE Developed Market ETF</strong>, <strong>VEA</strong> for more developed markets, and the <strong>iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF</strong>, <strong>EEM</strong>, for high-growth international companies.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you can handle the volatility, this portfolio is built for long-term high returns. If any of this information is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and I'll send you over additional sample allocation strategies every Sunday morning.</p>",
