  "content": "<h1>3 Compelling Reasons to Take Social Security at 62</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Reason 1: Break-even Point</h2>\n<p>By taking a lower benefit at 62, my break-even point versus full retirement age isn't until 77 years old.</p>\n\n<h2>Reason 2: Spending Trends After 65</h2>\n<p>If I make it to 65, yes, I have a 50% chance of living into my 80s. But guess what? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after 65, our spending drops dramatically\u2014on average, by 2.4% per year in real terms. So I'm not exactly going to need more money after 77.</p>\n\n<h2>Reason 3: Working After 62</h2>\n<p>Finally, if you want or need to continue working after 62, go ahead and do it. Because no, you do not end up losing money. Though your benefits will be docked in the short term, they will be recalculated at full retirement age to make up for the difference.</p>\n\n<p>So you do you, but just remember the great words of William Wallace: 'Every man dies, but not every man truly lives.' And say what you will about Mel Gibson, but he sure does know about story structure.</p>",
