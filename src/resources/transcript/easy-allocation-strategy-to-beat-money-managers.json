  "content": "<h1>The Easiest Allocation Strategy to Beat 90% of Money Managers</h1>\n<p>Instead of wasting your life trying to beat the stock market\u2014or worse, paying <strong>1%</strong> of your assets to a financial advisor to have them try to do it for you\u2014here's the single easiest allocation strategy that will most likely beat about <strong>90%</strong> of money managers worldwide over the next <strong>20 years</strong>. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you take charge of your investments.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Allocate to S&P 500</h2>\n<p><strong>70%</strong> of your assets would go to a fund that tracks the <strong>S&P 500</strong>, such as Vanguard's <strong>VOO</strong> or Fidelity's <strong>FXAIX</strong>. This is a solid foundation for growth as it represents a diverse set of leading companies.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in Bonds</h2>\n<p><strong>15%</strong> of your assets would go to a bond fund, like <strong>BND</strong> or <strong>JNK</strong> if you want a little more risk. Bonds can provide stability and a reliable income stream.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Add International Exposure</h2>\n<p>Finally, allocate the remaining <strong>15%</strong> to an international stock market fund, like Fidelity's <strong>FSPSX</strong> or Vanguard's <strong>VXUS</strong>. This will diversify your investment further by giving you access to global growth.</p>\n\n<p>Just know that about <strong>80%</strong> of all your future profits will most likely come from this initial asset allocation.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll continue sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
