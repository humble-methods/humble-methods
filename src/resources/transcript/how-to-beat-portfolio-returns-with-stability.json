  "content": "<h1>How to Beat Higher Returns with a Stable Portfolio</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how I can make a portfolio averaging 5% per year beat a portfolio averaging 5.5% per year over a 10-year time horizon.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio A vs. Portfolio B</h2>\n<p><strong>Number one:</strong> Portfolio A returns 5% per year for the next 10 consecutive years. With an initial investment of $100, it ends up being valued at $162.90.</p>\n<p><strong>Number two:</strong> Portfolio B returns 5.5% but has more volatility, meaning its returns fluctuate on an annual basis. Here\u2019s how it breaks down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Year one: 20% drop</li>\n<li>Year two: 20% gain</li>\n<li>Year three: 10% drop</li>\n<li>Year four: 10% gain</li>\n<li>Years five through eight: 10% gain</li>\n<li>Year nine: 5% gain</li>\n<li>Year ten: 10% gain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the same initial investment of $100, Portfolio B ends up being valued at $160.70, less than Portfolio A. Why? Because Portfolio A was able to take advantage of compound interest, whereas Portfolio B, even with a higher average return, had higher volatility and a lower 10-year return.</p>\n<h2>Questioning Financial Advice</h2>\n<p>So next time some financial guru tells you that just because the market has averaged 10% per year, you should therefore expect to compound your money at 10% per year, it might be a good time to question their guru status.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
