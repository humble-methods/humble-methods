  "content": "<h1>Top Investments to Beat Inflation</h1>\n<p>Here are the top three investments that you can make today to help you beat inflation before it eats your paycheck alive.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Gold</h2>\n<p>SPDR's GLD fund, with fees of 0.4%. Over the last five years, the value of gold has doubled. That's because the value of gold increases as the purchasing power of the dollar decreases. Gold tends to outpace inflation by about <strong>150%</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Real Estate</h2>\n<p>Crown Castle and Realty Income Group are two examples of real estate investment trusts that are currently paying a forward dividend of <strong>5.6%</strong> and <strong>5.9%</strong> respectively. That's outpacing inflation by almost <strong>100%</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Low-Cost Index Funds</h2>\n<p>Consider low-cost index funds like Vanguard's VOO or Fidelity's FXAIX, which have fees of <strong>0.015%</strong>. Historically, the stock market returns <strong>10%</strong>, which will outpace inflation by <strong>300%</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So now you have the tools, now you have the knowledge. Go do your research, have more of your money work for you and not someone else.</p>",
