  "content": "<h1>10 Essential Financial Moves to Maximize Your Wealth</h1>\n\n<p>Here are the 10 most important financial moves that I would make starting today to be as wealthy as I ever could be. I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Pay Down High-Interest Debt</h2>\n<p>This is a guaranteed 18 to 25% return.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Open a High Yield Savings Account</h2>\n<p>Open a high yield savings account through Everbank or SoFi, and fund it with three to six months of expenses. It has a zero dollar account minimum for a 5% APY.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Max Out Your Health Savings Account</h2>\n<p>This is the only 100% triple tax-advantaged account in the world. Contributions are deductible, investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals are tax-free as long as spent on qualifying medical expenses.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Maximize Your 401(k) Contributions</h2>\n<p>Put just enough in your 401(k) to ensure that you're getting the full company match. Otherwise, you're leaving free money on the table.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Max Out Roth IRA Contributions</h2>\n<p>Max out your and your partner's Roth IRA and never pay another penny of taxes on decades of compound growth.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Open a 529 Plan</h2>\n<p>Set your child up for tax-free withdrawals as long as spent on tuition, books, or K through 12 education. If they don't go to college, you can change the beneficiary.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Open a Custodial Roth IRA for Your Child</h2>\n<p>Fund it with up to $7,000 of your child's earnings and set them up to be a millionaire by retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>8. Consider Backdoor Roth Conversions</h2>\n<p>Utilize the backdoor or mega backdoor Roth conversion to avoid income limits on the Roth and enjoy up to $69,000 annually of tax-free growth.</p>\n\n<h2>9. Request Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation</h2>\n<p>Ask your employer to pay you 20 to 25% of your annual salary in non-qualified deferred compensation, deferring taxes until retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>10. Establish a Dynasty Trust</h2>\n<p>Consider placing all of these strategies in a dynasty trust that you can open in Delaware or Florida. This way, you can avoid estate expiration and preserve 100% of your estate for generations to come.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
