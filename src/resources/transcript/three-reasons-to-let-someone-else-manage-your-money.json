  "content": "<h1>Three Important Reasons to Consider Hiring a Financial Manager</h1>\n<p>Here are the only three reasons I would ever let someone else manage my money.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content with companies like Facet to show you what the future of financial planning looks like.</p>\n<h2>Reason #1: Lack of Time</h2>\n<p>No, I don't think it takes more than a few hours a quarter to check in on your investments. But if you are already spending those precious few hours doing anything but readjusting your portfolio, that's a good reason.</p>\n<h2>Reason #2: Lack of Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Do I think you can capture most of this knowledge by reading a couple great books about investing and personal finance? 100% I do. But I also know that some people enjoy going to the in-person checkout at the grocery store, even when there's no line at the self-checkout. Sometimes, it's nice to have a guide on the side when you're trying to figure out that six-digit product number of the avocado.</p>\n<h2>Reason #3: Lack of Desire</h2>\n<p>This is the one thing I definitely can't teach you. You either want to learn how to fish, or you want to be handed a fish. If you have zero desire to talk or learn about finance, kind of like my mother, that's a good reason to get some help.</p>\n<p>You can't just go halfway with one, two, or three. If you only have some time or enough knowledge to be dangerous, you will be dangerous to your long-term plan.</p>\n<p>Facet has the time, the skillset in their certified professional planners, and the desire to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
