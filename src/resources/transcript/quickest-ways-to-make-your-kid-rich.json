  "content": "<h1>Three Quick and Easy Ways to Build Wealth for Your Child</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, now dedicated to creating financial content for free.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest Early in a UGMA Account</h2>\n<p>Put <strong>$2,000</strong> for them in a <strong>Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)</strong> account the day they're born and invest it in low-cost index funds. This doesn't require earned income and doesn\u2019t have to be allocated for education. By age 65, they could have close to <strong>a million dollars</strong>!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Add Monthly Contributions</h2>\n<p>With the same <strong>$2,000</strong> investment in a UGMA account, add <strong>$100 a month</strong> once they turn 18. By approximately age 45, they will likely be a millionaire with access to their funds for any purpose.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Use a Custodial Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>When your child turns about <strong>8 years old</strong>, have them work for your small business and deposit <strong>$200 a month</strong> of their earnings into a custodial <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. Investing these funds in low-cost index funds can result in a couple of <strong>million dollars</strong> by retirement, all tax-free!</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow for more tips on securing your financial future and that of your children!</p>",
