  "content": "<h1>Three Costly Mistakes That Financial Gurus Get Wrong</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Paying off Credit Card Debt Before Getting Company Match</h2>\n<p>Traditional advice tells you to obliterate credit card debt first. But if your employer matches <strong>6%</strong> of your 401(k) contributions, that's a guaranteed <strong>50% to 100%</strong> return. Even with credit card debt at <strong>22% to 30%</strong>, grabbing the match first leaves you net positive.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Building a Six-Month Emergency Fund Before Getting Term Life Insurance</h2>\n<p>Fun fact: Term life insurance for a healthy 35-year-old costs about <strong>$40</strong> a month. If something happens in month three, your family might get the <strong>$500,000</strong> they actually need instead of just <strong>$120</strong> from your high yield savings account. Term insurance acts as your real emergency fund.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Maxing Your 401(k) Before Your Health Savings Account</h2>\n<p>Everyone says max the <strong>401(k)</strong> as quickly as possible. But if you're on a high deductible health plan, your Health Savings Account (HSA) offers even more tax advantages. After 65, your HSA operates like a pre-tax 401(k) anyway. Max the HSA first, then go back to contributing to the 401(k) after grabbing your match!</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
