  "content": "<h1>Designing a $100,000 Portfolio for Retirement in Your 50s</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest $40,000 into SCHD</h2>\n<p>This is Schwab's Dividend Stock ETF, holding about 100 of the best dividend payers like Chevron, Pfizer, and Coca-Cola. The current yield is around <strong>3.5%</strong>. Importantly, these are not just income stocks; they're dividend growers. Over the last decade, SCHD has returned about <strong>12% annually</strong>, offering both income and projected growth. That’s my kind of investment!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest $30,000 into VOO or SPLG</h2>\n<p>These are classic S&P 500 funds. As you might still live for another <strong>40 years</strong>, you'll need growth. Keep it simple; you don’t need to swing for the fences at this stage.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest $20,000 into BND or FBND</h2>\n<p>These are total bond market funds. As of year-end 2025, yields are decent again, around <strong>4% or 5%</strong>. Bonds often stabilize your portfolio, especially when stocks inevitably crash. While the old rule might suggest an age-based percentage in bonds, <strong>20%-30%</strong> in bonds during your 50s is just fine for most of us.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Invest $10,000 in a money market fund</h2>\n<p>Consider VMFXX or SPAXX, which are earning about <strong>4%</strong>. This serves as your 'sleep at night' money. It provides you with added liquidity, so if the market crashes right when you retire, you're not forced to sell stocks at a loss.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
