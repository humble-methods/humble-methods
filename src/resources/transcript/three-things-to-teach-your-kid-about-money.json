  "content": "<h1>3 Essential Money Lessons to Teach Your Kids Before It's Too Late</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Emotional Impact of Inheriting Money</h2>\n<p>Inheriting money is often emotional, not logical. Grief plus sudden wealth can equal terrible decisions. It's crucial to prepare your kids for the emotional aspects of handling money.</p>\n\n<h2>2. The Power of Early Gifting and Open Conversations</h2>\n<p>The best estate plan is often early gifting combined with open conversations. Money is awkward, but breaking the cycle by discussing finances early and often can equip your kids with the right mindset.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Trusts for Everyone, Not Just the Ultra-Rich</h2>\n<p>Trusts aren't just for the ultra-rich. No matter what some financial guru ding-dong on TikTok tells you, they can protect assets, teach stewardship, and prevent mistakesâ€”like cousin Eddie blowing half your estate on NFTs.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So talk early, talk often, and you'll all be in a better situation moving forward!</p>",
