I was thinking about $40,000 a year.</p>\n\n<h2>Is it Really Possible?</h2>\n<p>Oh, that's easy. Just get the biggest companies in the world to pay for your retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>Not What I Meant!</h2>\n<p>No, Dad, I said I want to retire, not keep working for big companies.</p>\n\n<h2>The Investment Strategy</h2>\n<p>No, you get the biggest companies to work for you. If you invest a million dollars in a dividend stock paying 4%, that's $40,000 a year in perpetuity.</p>\n\n<h2>Financial Independence</h2>\n<p>What, and they'll just pay for my retirement? Yep, you know, like a reward.</p>",
