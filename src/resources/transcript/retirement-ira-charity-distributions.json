You will owe us nothing.</p> <p>What did you find this time? I'm donating the distributions to a qualified charity of my choice.</p> <p>Do you consider us a charity? I've given you enough charity throughout my life.</p> <p>Besides, if I donate to charity, it takes care of my distribution, it doesn't trigger any taxes, and if I donate stock, the capital gains resets for the charity.</p> <p>I win, charity wins. And you? We lose. That's right.</p>",
