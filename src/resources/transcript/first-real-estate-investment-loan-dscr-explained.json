Here's a million bucks.</p> <p>Hello, bank? Uh, I'd also like that $1,000,000 loan for my first real estate investment property.</p> <p>Great! What's your DSCR?</p> <p>Excuse me? Your debt service coverage ratio?</p> <p>Huh? You know, your projected net operating income divided by your annual debt payment?</p> <p>Uh... The ratio of what you think you'll make versus what you will 100% owe to us.</p> <p>Okay, I'll bet it's a 1.</p> <p>Sorry, too low.</p> <p>But I would be able to pay you.</p> <p>Maybe.</p> <p>But if your projections come up too short, which they usually do, we need a little bit of a cushion.</p> <p>Besides, you should want to be over 1 so you can pay us back and show your investors a little bit of a return.</p> <p>That way, you might even attract additional capital in the future.</p> <p>Thanks for the free tip!</p> <p>Oh, don't worry. You'll be paying this back for years.</p>",
