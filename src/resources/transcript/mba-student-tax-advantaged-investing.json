  "content": "<h1>How MBA Students Can Leverage Taxes for a $150,000 Income</h1>\n<p>If you are an MBA student and you want to make over $150,000 right now, you might want to stick around for this. But first, I have good news and bad news.</p>\n<h2>Understanding Your Financial Status</h2>\n<p>The bad news is that when you're an MBA student, you're not making a lot of money. And the good news? When you're an MBA student, you're not making a lot of money either.</p>\n\n<h2>Maximizing Your 401k</h2>\n<p>So if you have a 401k from a previous employer and you convert that account today to a Roth IRA, you could make well over $150,000.</p>\n<p>Let's say you have $20,000 in an old 401k and you continue to fund that 401k with $500 a month for the next 20 years. You would have an account worth close to $526,000. However, because that 401k is tax-deferred, you\u2019re going to owe the government $150,000 of that money in taxes.</p>\n\n<h2>The Smart Move: Convert to Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>But let\u2019s say instead that you are a financially savvy MBA student and you decide to convert that 401k to a Roth today. In that case, you only owe $2,180 of that money in taxes. That account, funded with $500 a month over the next 20 years, will be worth close to $510,000.</p>\n<p>But here's the biggest upside: you won\u2019t owe one penny of that money to the government because you took advantage of your low status as an MBA student and invested for the long term in a tax-advantaged account.</p>\n\n<h2>A Final Note</h2>\n<p>Oh, and don\u2019t put MBA after your name when you get your degree. Not a good look.</p>",
