  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $1,000 Like a Professional Without Paying Fees</h1>\n<p>If you are looking to invest <strong>$1,000</strong> like a professional but don\u2019t want to pay <strong>1%</strong> of your money to a financial advisor, consider trying this three-step simple system. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you make informed investment decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>Warren Buffett's Advice</h2>\n<p>In his <strong>2013 letter</strong> to all shareholders, Warren Buffett, debatably the greatest investor of all time, advised his readers to invest <strong>10%</strong> of their assets in short-term treasuries and <strong>90%</strong> in a low-cost index fund. Here\u2019s exactly how you would do that:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a TreasuryDirect Account</h2>\n<p>Go to <strong>treasurydirect.gov</strong>. Open an account by providing some basic personal information and linking a bank account.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Purchase Treasury Bills</h2>\n<p>Now log in, navigate to <strong>Buy Direct</strong>, select <strong>Treasury Bills</strong>, and choose either the <strong>three- or six-month term</strong>. Buy these in multiples of <strong>$100</strong>, so you would typically buy one.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in a Low-Cost Index Fund</h2>\n<p>Now go to <strong>Fidelity, Schwab,</strong> or <strong>Vanguard</strong>. Open a brokerage account by providing some basic personal information and linking a bank account. Once that account is open and funded, purchase <strong>$900</strong> of a low-cost index fund like Vanguard's <strong>VOO</strong>, Fidelity's <strong>FXAIX</strong>, or Schwab's <strong>SWPPX</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Congratulations! You\u2019ve now invested <strong>10%</strong> of your assets in short-term treasuries and <strong>90%</strong> in a low-cost index fund. You can rest assured that you have followed the greatest wisdom from one of the best minds in investing for free.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
