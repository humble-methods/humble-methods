  "content": "<h1>Three Steps to Invest on Your Own and Build Wealth</h1>\n<p>If you want to be a millionaire yet find yourself throwing away tens of thousands of dollars in fees over the course of a lifetime by having a financial advisor invest your money for you, it\u2019s time for a change. It\u2019s okay; I\u2019ve got you. Here\u2019s what you need to do right now.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Open a <strong>brokerage account</strong> with Fidelity, Schwab, or Interactive Brokers. Fund that account with <strong>$25 to $50</strong> a week. Automate this habit! Otherwise, you\u2019re going to forget or continually think it\u2019s the wrong time to invest.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in Low-Cost Index Funds</h2>\n<p>Invest that money in a <strong>low-cost index fund</strong> like Fidelity's <strong>FXAIX</strong> or Vanguard's <strong>VOO</strong>. These funds will literally cost you <strong>50 times less</strong> than working with a financial advisor, and most of those advisors would place your money in the exact same funds anyway.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Commit to Consistency</h2>\n<p>Finally, never take your foot off the gas. Investing is a lot like marriage; you have to commit to staying with it through sickness and health, through economic booms and busts. If that doesn\u2019t sound like you, that\u2019s okay; this game might not be for you. But if you can make it through the first <strong>5 to 10 years</strong>, compound interest will take over, and you\u2019ll just need to sit back, relax, and enjoy your path to financial freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Or, you know, you could give your money to a financial advisor, and they could enjoy their path to financial freedom instead.</p>",
