  "content": "<h1>How to Cut $40,000-$50,000 Off Your Mortgage Interest</h1>\n<p>If you're in your 30s or 40s, and you want to cut $40,000 to $50,000 off your mortgage and pay it off five years earlier without increasing your monthly budget, here's what you need to do.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager; now I create financial content for you for free.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 1: Switch to Bi-Weekly Payments</h2>\n<p>Call your lender today and switch from monthly payments to bi-weekly payments. This simple change does not increase your total monthly payment, but it means you'll make half payments every two weeks.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 2: Make Extra Payments</h2>\n<p>By paying every two weeks, you'll make 26 half payments a year. That's like making 13 full payments instead of 12. These extra payments will accelerate the reduction of your principal and therefore the reduction of your interest.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 3: Enjoy the Benefits</h2>\n<p>Congrats! You've just knocked $45,000 off a $300,000 loan with a 4.25% 30-year fixed mortgage, reducing the term of your loan from 30 years to 25 years.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep helping you get one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
