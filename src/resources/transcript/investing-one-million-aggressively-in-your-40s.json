  "content": "<p>Here is exactly how I would invest <strong>$1 million</strong> if I were in my <strong>40s</strong> and wanted to be super aggressive with my investments.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former <strong>financial advisor</strong> and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>Core Holding: Investing in the S&P 500</h2>\n<p>Number one, I would put <strong>60%</strong> of my assets into a fund that tracks the <strong>S&P 500</strong> like <strong>Vanguard's VOO</strong>. It has a <strong>1.36%</strong> annual dividend payout and tracks an index that has a <strong>10%</strong> return since its inception. This would be considered my core holding.</p>\n<h2>Exploring High-Risk Investments</h2>\n<p>Number two, now I'd have some fun. Because I'm highly risk tolerant and I have a <strong>20-year time horizon</strong> before I plan on retiring, I might invest <strong>5%</strong> in a <strong>semiconductor fund</strong> like <strong>SMH</strong> or <strong>SOXQ</strong>. I might put another <strong>5%</strong> in <strong>BTC</strong> or <strong>ETH</strong>, just in case those crypto heads end up being right. And I'd put <strong>20%</strong> into an aggressive tax fund like <strong>Invesco's QQQM</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Cash Reserves for Market Corrections</h2>\n<p>And number three, I'd take the remaining <strong>$100,000</strong> and put it into a <strong>money market fund</strong>. They're currently returning about <strong>5%</strong>, but I wouldn't do this for the <strong>5%</strong> return. I would do it so that I had a cash holding for if and when the market inevitably corrects. That's when I would want some cash on the sideline.</p>\n<p>And I could immediately take advantage of a ton of great stocks at a highly discounted value. And I would just load up for the next bull run.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
