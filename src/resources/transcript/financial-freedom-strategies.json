  "content": "<h1>How to Achieve Financial Freedom</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how you're going to separate yourself from your friends and become financially free.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Open a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>\n<p>You're going to open a <strong>high-yield savings account</strong> where you can still get between <strong>four and 5%</strong> on that money. Commit <strong>30 to 40% of your next paycheck</strong> to that account. By earning that four or 5% immediately on your money, congratulations, you're now keeping up with inflation for your short-term or immediate goals.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in a Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Next, you're going to put <strong>3 to 5%</strong> of that paycheck directly into a <strong>brokerage account</strong> and invest it in a <strong>low-cost index fund</strong>. Not only are you now an investor, but you also have a fund set up for your short or midterm goals that will most likely outpace inflation and will eventually be taxed at a lower rate.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Contribute to a Retirement Account</h2>\n<p>Finally, you're going to place another <strong>3 to 5%</strong> of that paycheck into a retirement account, such as a <strong>401K, IRA, or 403B</strong>. Congratulations! According to the Survey of Consumer Finances, you're now among the illustrious <strong>54% of Americans</strong> who are saving for retirement, increasing your chances of affording your long-term goals.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, <a href=\"#\">like</a> and <a href=\"#\">follow</a>, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
