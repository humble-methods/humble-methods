During these slow times, dealerships are more motivated to sell you a car.</p>\n\n<h2>Number 9: Buy a Car That's Already on the Lot</h2>\n<p>Dealers receive most cars on credit and continue to incur interest until those cars are sold. Suggest taking a vehicle that's already on the lot for a reduced price.</p>\n\n<h2>Number 8: Never Go to the Dealer</h2>\n<p>Communicate via email instead. Send your best offer and mention that you're considering two local competitors. Let them know you're looking for them to earn your business.</p>\n\n<h2>Number 7: Do Your Market Research</h2>\n<p>Know the value of your desired car in advance. Start negotiations at 10% less than what you've found in your research.</p>\n\n<h2>Number 6: Always Be Ready to Walk Away</h2>\n<p>If the dealership senses that you need the car immediately, you lose negotiating power. The best price may come when they call you after you've already left the lot.</p>",
