  "content": "<h1>How to Invest Your First $1,000 in the Stock Market in Your 20s</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Buy Individual Stocks</h2>\n<p>I would start by buying individual stocks and tracking exactly how you feel and how you respond when they move up, down, and sideways. You want to know your emotional responses to market fluctuations.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Enjoy the Success</h2>\n<p>Let yourself believe you're a genius when one stock doubles in price. Go ahead, brag to all your friends about it. It's part of the fun!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Face the Downturns</h2>\n<p>Then, let one or three—or all of them—crash and burn. This experience will teach you about risk tolerance and how you personally respond to it better than any book or financial advisor ever could.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Investing Education</h2>\n<p>After all that, you will have officially spent $1,000 on the best investing education you will ever receive. By the time you’re in your early 20s, you’ll understand why the smartest investors in the world invest in index funds and ETFs.</p>",
