  "content": "<h1>Why I Will Spend 7% of My Money Annually in Retirement</h1>\n<p>Hello, I\u2019m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Today, I want to share exactly why I will be spending 7% of my money annually in retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>Embracing Life in Retirement</h2>\n<p>Number one, according to a <strong>2018 study by United Income</strong>, retirees die with <strong>80%</strong> of their money intact. That\u2019s not the legacy I aim for. </p>\n\n<h2>Spending Behavior in Retirement</h2>\n<p>Number two, a <strong>2022 study by the Federal Reserve</strong> shows that after the age of 65, we spend <strong>2.4%</strong> less per year in real terms. What does this mean? Simply, it\u2019s wise to spend it while you\u2019re <em>alive</em> and <em>mobile</em> and <em>healthy</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>The Drawdown Dilemma</h2>\n<p>Number three, the <strong>Seminole Trinity study</strong> found that retirees with a million dollars, drawing down <strong>4%</strong> annually, often end up dying with an average of <strong>$6 million</strong> left in their portfolios. That\u2019s a lot of missed moments with loved ones.</p>\n\n<h2>Changing the Retirement Spending Narrative</h2>\n<p>Finally, according to a <strong>2023 report from Morningstar</strong>, retirees are currently spending just <strong>2.8%</strong> of their nest egg each year. This frugality stems from the fear of running out of money in retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>Living Without Regrets</h2>\n<p>However, I\u2019d rather run out of money than out of time. I refuse to spend <strong>20 to 30 years</strong> of my retirement deferring the joy that I worked <strong>40 years</strong> to attain. If any of this resonates with you, don\u2019t forget to <strong>like and follow</strong>, and I\u2019ll continue to help guide you toward financial empowerment.</p>",
