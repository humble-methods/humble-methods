  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $3,000,000 in Retirement Without Running Out of Money</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Two Years in Cash Equivalents</h2>\n<p>I’d start by setting aside <strong>two years' worth</strong> of spending in cash equivalents. That’s <strong>$200,000</strong> if you spend <strong>$100,000</strong> a year. This fund is for spending without having to sell investments, not a panic fund that you never touch!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Investment in a Low-Cost Index Fund</h2>\n<p>Next, I’d invest the rest in one low-cost index fund, like <strong>Fidelity's FXAIX</strong>. With <strong>$2.8 million</strong> at an average <strong>7%</strong> return, that averages about <strong>$196,000</strong> a year in growth. It’s like hiring the stock market as your side hustle—only you don't have to work, and you're the one getting paid!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Strategic Rebalancing</h2>\n<p>Finally, I’d rebalance only when markets are up. If it’s a down year, I’ll spend from the cash. If it’s an up year, trim the gains and refill the cash bucket. It’s boring, it’s disciplined, and it works—unlike my plan to grow citrus in <strong>Vermont</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
