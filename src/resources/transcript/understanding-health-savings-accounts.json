  "content": "<p>Hey dad, could you tell me something that seems illegal but isn't?</p><p>Absolutely! Each year I shelter just under $8,000 of our income from the IRS. Is this just some secret of the rich?</p><p>Nope! Anybody can take advantage of contributing to a health savings account.</p><p>Are those contributions taxed?</p><p>Nope!</p><p>Oh, so it's like a traditional IRA and that money is taxed when you spend it?</p><p>Nope!</p><p>So is it just some stupid savings account?</p><p>Nope! I can even invest the money within the account for tax-free growth.</p><p>So what's the catch?</p><p>The money just has to be spent on qualifying medical expenses.</p><p>Look, we all inevitably have to pay for our health costs anyway, right?</p><p>Right. So why not pay for those costs with the only 100% tax-free investment plan?</p><p>But doesn't that account get lost if you don't spend it in one calendar year?</p><p>That's an FSA, son. This one rolls over forever.</p><p>Which is good because you will need to tap into that HSA when I need my hearing aids, physical therapy, dentures, x-rays, and eyeglasses.</p><p>Got you, dad.</p>",
