  "content": "<h1>Three Biggest Financial Red Flags in Relationships You Must Know</h1> <p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free to help you avoid costly mistakes. Here are the three biggest financial red flags in your relationship:</p> <h2>1. Financial Secrecy</h2> <p>If your partner is hiding spending, debt, or accounts from you, it's a major problem. According to a TD Bank survey, 43% of people admit to financial infidelity. If they\u2019re hiding this from you, what else are they concealing?</p> <h2>2. Financial Access</h2> <p>You should have usernames, passwords, and knowledge of all financial accounts for both you and your partner. If you don\u2019t, then you've got some homework, and it's due right now.</p> <h2>3. Financial Control</h2> <p>The biggest red flag of them all is financial control. If you hear someone say they don't worry about finances because their partner takes care of it, take note. Remember, 80% of women die widowed or divorced, and 50% of couples get divorced. By leaving finances to your partner, you're gifting them a significant advantage in life.</p> <p>Talking about money is challenging. However, discussing finances while grieving a loss or going through a divorce is much tougher. Prioritize these conversations now while things are good\u2014or at least kind of good.</p>",
