  "content": "<h2>Investing for Retirement</h2>\n<p>Here is how I would invest <strong>$1 million</strong> in retirement if I wanted to live off of <strong>$100,000 a year</strong> for <strong>15 years</strong>. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Stock Fund Investments</h3>\n<p>I would invest <strong>$600,000</strong> in a mix of stock funds:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$200,000</strong> in a fund like <em>SCHD</em> for dividends,</li>\n<li><strong>$200,000</strong> in a fund like <em>FXAIX</em> for a low-cost index fund,</li>\n<li><strong>$200,000</strong> in a fund like <em>QQQM</em> for some aggressive growth.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<h3>2. Bond Investments</h3>\n<p>The remaining <strong>$400,000</strong> would go into government bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds. I might do this through a fund like <em>iShares IGIB</em> or <em>SPDRs SPIB</em>.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Annual Withdrawals and Rebalancing</h3>\n<p>At the beginning of each calendar year, I would sell <strong>$60,000</strong> of stocks and enough of the bonds to complement my annual coupon payments that I'd received from the bonds. This helps maintain a stable income stream.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I would rebalance the portfolio annually to ensure I never stray too far from my <strong>60-40 split</strong> between stocks and bonds.</p>\n\n<h4>Will This Strategy Work in All Market Conditions?</h4>\n<p>Absolutely not. Will any strategy work in all market conditions? Probably not. If you find any of this information helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
