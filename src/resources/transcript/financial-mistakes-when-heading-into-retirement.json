  "content": "<h1>The Top Financial Mistake to Avoid Before Retirement</h1>\n<p>Here is one of the top financial mistakes that people make as they head into retirement. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you plan for your future.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Misguided Questions About Retirement Savings</h2>\n<p>Most people are asking how much money they\u2019re going to need overall before they\u2019re ready to retire. Is it <strong>$1 million</strong>, <strong>$3 million</strong>, or <strong>$50 million</strong>?</p>\n\n<h2>2. The Mistake: Asking the Wrong Question</h2>\n<p>And that\u2019s the mistake. We\u2019re focusing on the wrong question. It\u2019s not about what we have as a principal investment; it\u2019s about what you\u2019re looking to spend each year to live comfortably in retirement. Maybe you\u2019re comfortable spending <strong>$40,000</strong> a year and you\u2019d be just fine. Or perhaps you know that you're going to need closer to <strong>$400,000</strong> a year to maintain the lifestyle you\u2019ve come to know and love.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Calculating Your Target</h2>\n<p>So once you determine that annual spending number, just multiply it by <strong>25</strong>. And boom, there\u2019s your target <strong>FU money</strong>. Stop putting the cart before the horse and comparing your net worth to someone else's; it is always and forever relative and irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
