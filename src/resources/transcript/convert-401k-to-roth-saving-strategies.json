  "content": "<h1>Converting Your 401(k) to a Roth IRA</h1>\n<p>If you have a 401(k) from an old employer, and you've been thinking about converting it to a Roth, you could save well over $150,000 over just the next 20 years by doing that today.</p>\n<p>Don't believe me? Here's the math:</p>\n<h2>The Numbers Behind the Conversion</h2>\n<p>If you have a 401(k) that has $20,000 in it, and you fund it with an additional $500 a month for the next 20 years, that account could be worth close to $526,000.</p>\n<p>However, it's a tax-deferred account. You're going to owe the government $150,000 of that money. But if you were to convert that $20,000 today, you only end up paying about $2,000 in taxes up front.</p>\n<p>Now, that $18,000, funded with another $500 a month for the next 20 years, is also going to be worth about $520,000. The difference is that you won't owe one penny of that money to the government.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>This is not advice. Do your own homework and your own research. And don't ever take advice from some ding-dong walking through the woods with a phone.</p>",
