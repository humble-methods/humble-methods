  "content": "<h1>10 Personal Finance Lessons You Were Never Taught in School</h1>\n<p>Is it true that you\u2019ve spent just under a million dollars on your education so far?</p>\n<p>Yep.</p>\n<p>Could you tell me the top 10 things you were never taught about personal finance in any of those schools?</p>\n<p>Absolutely.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Impact of Inflation</h2>\n<p><strong>Number 10</strong> is easily the most important for me personally: <strong>inflation</strong> will eat your money if you don\u2019t learn to invest it in vehicles that keep pace with or outpace it.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Government Taxes</h2>\n<p><strong>Number 2</strong>: The government will take more of your money than they should if you don\u2019t learn how to protect it.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Keeping Money in Banks</h2>\n<p><strong>Number 3</strong>: By keeping your money in a bank, you are literally letting other people make money off of your money.</p>\n\n<h2>4. The 50-30-20 Rule</h2>\n<p><strong>Number 4</strong>: Following the <strong>50-30-20 rule</strong> will keep you poor.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Small Daily Investments</h2>\n<p><strong>Number 5</strong>: Investing <strong>$3.47</strong> a day into a low-cost index fund at the age of <strong>20</strong> will actually make you rich.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Understanding Interest Rates</h2>\n<p><strong>Number 6</strong>: Remember that when interest rates go up, that can be a good thing because we can lock in long-term rates to lend our money.</p>\n\n<h2>7. The Joneses Mentality</h2>\n<p><strong>Number 7</strong>: You should never try to keep up with the <strong>Joneses</strong> because once you finally catch up, there\u2019s always going to be another one right down the road.</p>\n\n<h2>8. Market Predictions</h2>\n<p><strong>Number 8</strong>: You cannot predict the market, and neither can I, so you better learn to <strong>dollar-cost average</strong> now.</p>\n\n<h2>9. The Importance of Reading</h2>\n<p><strong>Number 9</strong>: Read every single personal finance book you can get your hands on and then read some more.</p>\n\n<h2>10. Hidden Aspects of Wealth</h2>\n<p><strong>Number 10</strong>: Remember that wealth has always been what you do not see. If you spend it, you no longer have it.</p>\n<p>But is that why you only have eight articles of clothing and all of them have holes in them?</p>\n<p>Yep. That and I follow <strong>Social Cat</strong>.</p>",
