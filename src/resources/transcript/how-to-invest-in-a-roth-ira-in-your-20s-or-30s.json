  "content": "<h1>How to Invest in a Roth IRA in Your 20s or 30s</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in a Total Market Fund</h2>\n<p>Start by putting your money in a <strong>total market fund</strong>. There’s no guessing, no flexing—just quiet compounding that will work for you over time.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Choose the Lowest Expense Ratio</h2>\n<p>Look for funds with the <strong>lowest expense ratio possible</strong>. My funds are all <strong>0.03%</strong> or lower because every tenth of a percent you save is yours forever.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Automate Your Investments</h2>\n<p>Now, automate your investments monthly. The amount doesn’t matter; what matters is the habit. The goal is not to be clever in your 20s or 30s; it’s to set it, forget it, and be done early so you never have to think about it again.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, check out my podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, where we’ll go over all of this in far more detail.</p>",
