  "content": "<h1>3 Reasons I Will Never Invest in Bonds</h1>\n<p>Here are the three reasons I will never invest in <strong>bonds</strong>. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help you make informed decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Interest Rate Risk</h2>\n<p>First, consider interest rate risk. If rates go from <strong>2%</strong> to <strong>4%</strong>, no one wants your <strong>2%</strong> bond when they can now get a bond for <strong>4%</strong>. If you need to sell it, you’d have to do so at a discount.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Inflation Risk</h2>\n<p>Next is inflation risk. If you have that same <strong>2%</strong> bond and inflation is <strong>2.5%</strong>, you’re looking at a negative <strong>0.5%</strong> return on that bond. You're essentially losing money.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Opportunity Cost</h2>\n<p>Finally, let’s talk about opportunity cost. As we live longer and healthier lives, many of us underestimate the growth we actually need in retirement to afford our desired lifestyles. Trading <strong>40%</strong> of your portfolio at the age of <strong>60</strong> for some concept of principal protection may not be as protective as you think. But that’s up to you and always will be.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter in my bio. Every Sunday morning, I’ll send you over thoughts to hopefully get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
