I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help you succeed.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Save Early and Often</h2>\n<p>Save as early and as much as possible.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Avoid FOMO Investments</h2>\n<p>Do not invest in something just because others are doing it. If you heard about it on social media, it\u2019s too late and you\u2019re throwing your money away.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Be Wary of High Dividends</h2>\n<p>Don't ever invest in something just because it has a ridiculously high dividend. Remember: <strong>20% of zero is zero</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Your Home is Not a Bank</h2>\n<p>Your home is not a bank. Don't use it as one.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Understand Crypto and Commodities</h2>\n<p>Remember that crypto and commodities are not investments; they are stores of value and are ridiculously volatile and speculative.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Question Financial Advisors</h2>\n<p>Remember that brokers and mutual fund managers are salespeople whose job it is to make money from you, not for you.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Invest What You Understand</h2>\n<p>If you don\u2019t understand it, do not invest a penny in it.</p>\n\n<h2>8. Caution with Bonds</h2>\n<p>Do not invest in bonds just because you\u2019ve heard they\u2019re safer than stocks. Ever been in a bond fund when interest rates are going up? Yeah.</p>\n\n<h2>9. Have a Written Plan</h2>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a written down plan for investing, don\u2019t invest. And no, \u201cbecome rich\u201d is not a plan.</p>\n\n<h2>10. Control Your Emotions</h2>\n<p>Pretend you\u2019d be a far better investor if you never acted on any of your emotions.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll continue sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
