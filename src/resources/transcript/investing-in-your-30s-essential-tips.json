  "content": "<h2>Three Things to Know About Investing in Your 30s</h2>\n<p>Here are the only three things you will ever need to know about investing in your 30s. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h3>1. Start Investing Weekly</h3>\n<p>If you were to invest $110 a week in a low-cost index fund like Vanguard's VOO and earn the historical average on the S&P 500 of 10%, by the time you're 60, you'll most likely have close to a million dollars.</p>\n<h3>2. Consider the Impact of Inflation</h3>\n<p>However, a million dollars will not have the same purchasing power that it does today because of inflation. Adjusting for a national average of 3% annual inflation, we recalibrate. Instead of 10%, let\u2019s use 7%. That same $110 a week over the next 30 years will be worth $540,000 in today's dollars.</p>\n<h3>3. The Cost of Inaction</h3>\n<p>Alternatively, you could convince yourself that $100 a week isn\u2019t significant. By leaving that money in a savings account, instead of gaining 7% per year, you\u2019re losing out 3% per year. In 30 years, $158,000 of your hard-earned money will only equate to the purchasing power of $63,000.</p>\n<p>So the choice is yours. You can keep telling yourself that a hundred bucks here and there won't make a difference, or you can realize that by leaving your money in cash, you are literally missing out on a half million dollar opportunity of real money.</p>",
