  "content": "<h1>Why RSUs Might Be the Dumbest Loyalty Move in All of Business</h1>\n<p>Here's why RSUs might not be the best decision.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Concentrated Risk</h2>\n<p>You’re doubling down on your employer's success, and considering that <strong>65%</strong> of businesses fail within the first <strong>10 years</strong>, cool, hope you like concentrated risk and coin flips with tails on both sides.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Tax Avoidance Is Not a Strategy</h2>\n<p><em>I don’t want to get taxed</em> is not a strategy. You’re going to get taxed at some point, so rip the band-aid and diversify your investments.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Risk of Losing Everything</h2>\n<p>If the stock drops and you get laid off, you’ll lose your income AND your investment. You might find yourself nodding in synergy meetings while silently wishing you had diversified the day before.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Diversify today before your startup company reminds you why you should have yesterday.
