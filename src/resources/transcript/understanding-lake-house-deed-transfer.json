  "content": "<p><strong>Dialogue on Deed Ownership</strong></p>\n<p>Hey dad, could you put my name on the deed to the new lake house?</p>\n<p>Nope. Give me one good reason why not.</p>\n<p>I'll give you five.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Number five.</strong> Put your name on the deed. You own half the house and I lose control. You know I have control issues.</li>\n  <li><strong>Number four.</strong> If you die before me, the house might go to your heirs. Honestly, I do not like your children. I'm sorry, I don't.</li>\n  <li><strong>Number three.</strong> You're not a great businessman and you've already been sued multiple times. If I put your name on the deed, the house is now an asset of yours, and the creditors can take it from me.</li>\n  <li><strong>Number two.</strong> The current market value of the house is $500,000. If I put your name on it, I've just gifted you $250,000.</li>\n  <li><strong>Number one.</strong> If I give you half the house now, and I die in 20 years, we'll owe cap gains on 20 years of appreciation. If I wait and gift it to you through a trust, no cap gains taxes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Follow Social Cap</strong></p>\n<p>Where did you learn all this? Just follow Social Cap. It makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
