And if you get it, I'll take you out to Jersey Mike's for a sandwich.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. And now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>The Investment Question</h2>\n<p>Number one, take two portfolios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Portfolio A:</strong> makes 20% this year and 0% next year.</li>\n<li><strong>Portfolio B:</strong> makes 10% this year and 10% next year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which portfolio made more money after two years?</p>\n\n<h2>The Answer</h2>\n<p>Number two, if you said, well, they both made 10% per year, you're correct. But if you said they both made the same amount of money after two years, you are not correct.</p>\n\n<h2>Evaluating Returns</h2>\n<p>Number three, although both Portfolio A and Portfolio B averaged 10% per year, at the end of two years, Portfolio A will have earned 20% on two-year returns. While Portfolio B would have earned 21%.</p>",
