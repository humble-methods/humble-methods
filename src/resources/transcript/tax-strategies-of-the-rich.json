It\u2019s over <strong>6,000 pounds</strong>. Thank you, <strong>Section 179</strong>.</p>\n<p>I am planning on having you inherit about <strong>$2 million</strong> worth of stock. Out of that, <strong>$1.5 million</strong> is capital gains, but you will not pay a dime in taxes on those capital gains. We know that when I die, there will be a <strong>cost-basis reset</strong> on the stock.</p>\n<p>Where did you learn all this?</p>\n<p>I\u2019d love to say it\u2019s because I follow <strong>Social Cap</strong>, but that would be silly because I\u2019d be trusting a random online resource.</p>\n<p><strong>IRS.gov</strong>.</p>\n<p>Again?</p>\n<p>Always, son.</p>",
