Now, I create financial content for free, so you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in a Low-Cost Index Fund</h2>\n<p>I would put 70% of my money into a low-cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500. Settle down, we need to work on our core before getting to our biceps.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Allocate to Emerging Markets</h2>\n<p>Next, I might put 15% of my money into an emerging markets fund that tracks the economies of countries like China, India, Brazil, and South Africa. Yes, there's some additional risk, but there\u2019s also the potential for greater long-term reward.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Consider Small-Cap Stocks</h2>\n<p>Lastly, I might allocate the remaining 15% into a small-cap fund. Over the last century, small-cap stocks have beaten large-cap stocks by almost 1.5% annually. However, keep in mind that this is only over the very long term, as these stocks can be highly volatile and tend to have significant downswings too.</p>\n<p>So if we\u2019re talking about a 10-year horizon, maybe not. And if any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
