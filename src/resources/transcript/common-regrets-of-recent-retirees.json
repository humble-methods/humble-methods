  "content": "<h1>Common Regrets of Recent Retirees</h1>\n<p>Here are three of the most common regrets I hear from people who have recently retired. If this sounds like you, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Staying in Unfulfilling Jobs</h2>\n<p>Many retirees stayed in jobs that didn't bring them joy for too long, trying to max out one more account. What they didn't realize is that there is no magic number. We've been taught to always value more money over less money. The only problem is, even once we hit some magic number, we might find that we now have less time. We'll quickly learn that's the only thing we should have been valuing all along.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Hoarding Money Instead of Enjoying It</h2>\n<p>They never shifted gears from hoarding money to enjoying money. The most discouraging truth about money is that we're taught to hoard it and that saving is a virtue. Don't buy the latte, and definitely don't lease that new car. But what can I do with my money? Remember, the earlier you spend your money on good experiences, the longer that experience stays with you and compounds.</p>\n\n<h2>3. More Money, Less Mobility and Clarity</h2>\n<p>Even though they might have more money now, they might have less mobility and less mental clarity. And when it happens, it happens quickly. I guess many of you will share in the comments just how quickly. For those who haven't seen that yet, check the comments. You don't just need a withdrawal plan; you need a permission plan. And I hereby give you permission for what it's worth to start enjoying right now.</p>",
