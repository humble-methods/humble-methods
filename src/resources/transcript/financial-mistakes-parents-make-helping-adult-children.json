  "content": "<h1>3 Financial Mistakes Parents Make When Helping Adult Children</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Giving Too Much Too Early</h2>\n<p>Money without context can be very dangerous. If your <strong>22-year-old</strong> suddenly inherits a beachfront condo, the only thing growing is their Uber Eats bill—or that's YOUR Uber Eats bill!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Tying Strings to Every Dollar</h2>\n<p>If you're going to gift money, do it cleanly. Don't give them funds for freedom while micromanaging how they choose to use it. That’s not generosity; that's a second job.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Waiting Too Long to Help</h2>\n<p>Some parents wait until they're gone to offer support. But your kids might need help at <strong>35</strong>, not <strong>65</strong>. Money with timing is far more powerful than money with instructions.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
