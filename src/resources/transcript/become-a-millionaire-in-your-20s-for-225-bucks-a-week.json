  "content": "<h1>How to Become a Millionaire in Your 20s with Just $225 a Week</h1>\n<p>If I were in my 20s, here's exactly how I'd become a millionaire for 225 bucks a week. My name is Tyler, and I’m a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open and Fund a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>First, open and fund a Roth IRA with <strong>$150 a week</strong>. By the time you reach 60 years old, you could have <strong>$1.5 million</strong> in tax-free money.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Open a Taxable Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Next, open and fund a taxable brokerage account with <strong>$50 a week</strong>. Invest this in low-cost index funds, and by retirement, you could have another <strong>half a million</strong> dollars. The major benefit is that you can access all of that money, including the capital gains, at any time, as long as you've held the funds for over a year. You’ll pay even less tax than on your ordinary income.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Open and Fund a Health Savings Account</h2>\n<p>Finally, open and fund a health savings account (HSA) with <strong>$25 a week</strong>. Invest this in low-cost index funds to take the tax break now and let it grow tax-free. As long as you spend it on qualifying healthcare needs, you could have over <strong>$250,000</strong> in 100% tax-free money.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
