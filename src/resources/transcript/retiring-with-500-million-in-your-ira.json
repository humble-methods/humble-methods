  "content": "<p><strong>Tyler?</strong> Yep. Looks like you're retiring with <strong>500 million dollars</strong> in your IRA? That can't be right.</p>\n<p>Oh, it's right. We've only allowed you to contribute <strong>6,000 dollars</strong> a year.</p>\n<p>Yeah, but it's a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. Capital gains are tax-free, right?</p>\n<p>Yeah. Because I knew capital gains would eventually be tax-free, and I'm a highly <strong>risk-tolerant investor</strong>, I just put all <strong>6,000</strong> each year into <strong>super risky stocks</strong>.</p>\n<p>Did you ever lose that money?</p>\n<p>Oh, yeah. I lost <strong>9 out of 10 times</strong>. But because I started using this strategy when I was <strong>22</strong>, I had a very long time horizon and a lot of freedom to fail. And eventually some of those stocks hit big. Really big.</p>\n<p>So we get nothing.</p>",
