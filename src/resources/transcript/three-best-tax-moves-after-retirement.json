  "content": "<h1>3 Best Tax Moves You Can Make After You Retire</h1>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Every Sunday morning, I'll send you over some more thoughts like this.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Roth Conversions Before RMDs Kick In</h2>\n<p>Most retirees don't realize that once RMDs start at <strong>73</strong>, they can force you into a higher tax bracket. The fix? Roth conversions early in your retirement when you can control the tax bracket you're in. Future withdrawals would be completely tax-free.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Pay 0% on Capital Gains</h2>\n<p>Learn how to pay <strong>0%</strong> on capital gains and make that your income. If your taxable income is under <strong>$96,700</strong> for married filing jointly in <strong>2025</strong>, you pay <strong>0%</strong> on capital gains. This is a massive opportunity during lower income years before claiming Social Security.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Withdraw Your Money in a Strategic Order</h2>\n<p>Start with taxable accounts, as capital gains will be taxed at lower rates or zero. Move to tax-deferred accounts, because you have to withdraw those at some point. Finally, use Roths last, as you want them to continue to grow tax-free and they are phenomenal for estate planning.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this was helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
