  "content": "<h1>The Essential Question to Ask a Financial Planner</h1>\n<p>Here is the only question you ever need to ask a financial planner to see if they’re the right fit for you: <strong>How will you invest my money?</strong></p>\n\n<h2>1. Simple Investment Strategies</h2>\n<p>The good advisors keep it simple. They focus on <strong>low-cost index funds</strong>, <strong>ETFs</strong>, and broad diversification—stocks, bonds, and alternatives. The others tend to give you layers of high-fee, actively managed funds that eat into your returns and usually aren’t necessary.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Tax Strategies</h2>\n<p>The good ones help with <strong>tax strategies</strong> that could lower your tax bill. They use tools like <strong>direct indexing</strong> so you stay fully invested while harvesting losses to offset gains. The others can actually raise your tax bill each year by sticking you in actively managed funds that can trigger surprise capital gains that you don’t currently need.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Conflict of Interest</h2>\n<p>The good ones don’t take commissions for selling you products because they understand that this creates a conflict of interest. If someone is paid considerably to push a product, it might be right for them, but not for you.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Look, you do you. But if I were me—and I am me—I’d go directly to <strong>facet.com/tyler</strong> today and join the countless other members of my community who have already let me know that by working with <strong>Facet</strong>, they are indeed one step closer to where they need to be.</p>",
