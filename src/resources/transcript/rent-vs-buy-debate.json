  "content": "<h1>Rent vs. Buy Debate: Who Really Wins?</h1>\n<p>You know who wins the rent versus buy debate? Nobody, and here's why.</p>\n\n<p>Renters think they're winning because they're flexible and have no annual maintenance costs. Homeowners think they're winning because they're building equity and don't have to deal with a landlord. Meanwhile, both of you are writing massive checks every single month and getting absolutely nothing back for it, until now.</p>\n\n<h2>Introducing BILT</h2>\n<p>BILT is a membership program built around your biggest expense, your home. BILT earns you rewards that can be applied towards flights, hotels, dining, and my personal favorite, SoulCycle classes.</p>\n\n<h2>The BILT Credit Cards</h2>\n<p>Even better, BILT just launched three brand new credit cards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BILT Blue:</strong> If you want to keep it simple and you're new to the world of credit cards.</li>\n<li><strong>BILT Obsidian:</strong> If you're like me and spend more on food each month than you care to admit as a personal finance creator.</li>\n<li><strong>BILT Palladium:</strong> The premium card that helps you keep everything in one place and can earn you points across housing, travel, and life.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So whether you rent or own, it doesn't matter because now we can all be rewarded. Go to <a href=\"https://BILT.com/card\">BILT.com/card</a> to learn more. And let me know in the comments which side of the debate you're on.</p>",
