  "content": "<h1>Why Trump's Proposal to Add More 401k Investment Options is a Good Thing</h1>\n<p>Breaking news! Trump wants you to be able to invest in more things in your 401k. And apparently, that means the sky is falling. Here are five reasons why this change is a very, very good thing for you.</p>\n\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. More Options</h2>\n<p>You would have more options. Nobody's auto-enrolling you into some Cayman hedge fund. You still click the buttons, and if you want, you could ignore every new asset class and stick to your <strong>S&P 500</strong> fund.</p>\n\n<h2>2. More Access</h2>\n<p>You want more access. For decades, <strong>401ks</strong> have been the blandest salad bar in finance. This is like adding grilled chicken, olives, and an actual dressing with some saturated fat. You don't have to take them, but aren't you glad they're there?</p>\n\n<h2>3. Taking on Long-Term Risk</h2>\n<p>Retirement accounts are the single best place for taking on long-term risk. Risky, illiquid assets can thrive when you give them <strong>20, 30, or 40 years</strong> to compound. That’s exactly what a retirement account is for. For instance, private equity has historically beaten public markets over a long enough time horizon.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Diversification at Any Age</h2>\n<p>Even if you're already retired and don’t have <strong>40 years</strong>, adding non-correlated assets can reduce your portfolio swings, allowing you to smooth the ride instead of just chasing returns. This is textbook asset allocation.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Know Your Fees</h2>\n<p>Higher fees? That's a you problem. Yes, some of these funds may come with higher fees. They always have in any account type. The trick is to know that before you click buy. And remember, you don't have to buy any of this. It's optionality, not obligation.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So let's stop acting like your 401k is about to be hijacked by a bunch of crypto bros. This means more freedom, more choices, and yes, more responsibility to learn what you're investing in—exactly what grown-ups should want to do in their retirement accounts.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
