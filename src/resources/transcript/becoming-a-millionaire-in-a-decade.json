  "content": "<h1>3 Steps to Become a Millionaire in Your 20s</h1>\n<p>If I were in my <strong>20s</strong> and had to start all over again, here are the three things I would do to become a millionaire within a decade. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help guide your journey to wealth.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Diversify Your Income Streams</h2>\n<p>I would diversify my <strong>income streams</strong>. Too many of us rely on one W-2 paycheck. A silver lining of the COVID era is that we've finally reached a point where we can work anywhere, at any time, and become brand authorities with nothing more than a phone and some passion. I currently have <strong>eight streams of income</strong>. None of them are fancy, but they give me the freedom and flexibility to never have to rely on one job for my financial comfort.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Automate Paying Yourself</h2>\n<p>I would automate paying myself <strong>20%</strong> of every single paycheck from all my income streams. I would put every dime of that money into <strong>tax-advantaged accounts</strong>: brokerage accounts, <strong>Roth IRA</strong>, <strong>Roth 401(k)</strong>, additional <strong>401(k)</strong>, <strong>HSA</strong>, <strong>SEP IRAs</strong>. Yes, this would force me to live on much less, but in a decade, I\u2019ll be the one living on way more.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in Low-Cost Aggressive Index Funds</h2>\n<p>I would immediately invest as much money as I could afford to lose into a <strong>low-cost aggressive index fund</strong>, such as Invesco\u2019s <strong>QQQ</strong> or Vanguard\u2019s <strong>VUG</strong>. If I did this when I was <strong>19</strong> years old and invested another <strong>$2,000</strong> a year until I was <strong>27</strong>, I would most likely have a million dollars in that account alone by <strong>65</strong>. However, if I waited to start until I was <strong>27</strong>, I would still not have as much money at <strong>65</strong> as I would with my first strategy.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
