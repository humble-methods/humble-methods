  "content": "<h1>Investing Your First $10,000 in 2026 for Peace of Mind</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Total U.S. Stock Market Fund</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>$5,000</strong> into a total U.S. stock market fund like Vanguard's VTI or Schwab's SWTSX. This gives you ownership of nearly every publicly traded company in America, from Apple and NVIDIA to the guy in Idaho making screws for Apple and NVIDIA.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Total International Fund</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>$2,000</strong> into a total international fund like VXUS or IXUS. As 2025 reminded us, the U.S. isn't the only place where capitalism works.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Dividend ETF</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>$1,500</strong> into a dividend ETF like SCHD or DGRO. These are your grown-up stocks—slightly boring but relatively stable. They quietly compound while everyone else chases the next Tesla. Just make sure to hold this in a tax-advantaged account like a 401k or an IRA to avoid unnecessary taxes.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Money Market Fund</h2>\n<p>I would put <strong>$1,000</strong> into a money market fund like SPAXX or BIL. This is your \"I-wanna-look-smart-when-the-market-drops\" money, still earning around 4% or 5% while remaining liquid.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Individual Stocks</h2>\n<p>Finally, I would invest <strong>$500</strong> (just 5% of my portfolio) into individual stocks. Contrary to popular belief, one investment in an index fund won't necessarily take you from $10K to $100K; you need exposure to potential individual winners.</p>\n\n<p>And that's it! This strategy makes you globally diversified, tax-efficient, earning dividends, holding cash, and learning through experience. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
