  "content": "<h1>Stop Giving Away Your Money: 2 Myths and 1 Solution</h1>\n<p>Here are the two ways that you have been completely brainwashed to give away all of your money, and the one way that you can put a stop to it today. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help you make informed decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Automating Payments to Others</h2>\n<p>You have been led to believe that it\u2019s a good thing to automate paying other people first. Yes, it's easy to automate your bills. And no, you don\u2019t have to think about it. And that\u2019s the problem. You\u2019re not considering how much of your money is flying out the door every single month.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Monthly Subscription Payments</h2>\n<p>You\u2019ve also been conditioned to think in terms of <strong>monthly subscription payments</strong>. Oh, it\u2019s only <strong>$3 a month</strong>, <strong>$11 a month</strong>, <strong>$2.99 a month</strong>, <strong>$4 a month</strong>. But it\u2019s not just <strong>$5 a month</strong>. It\u2019s <strong>$60 a year</strong> for the rest of your life, just for that one random show you don\u2019t even like that much!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Automate Paying Yourself First</h2>\n<p>Now, you need to flip that script. De-automate paying other people, think in terms of the true cost over time, and starting today, automate paying yourself that <strong>$3 a month</strong> first. Put it into a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> and invest it in <strong>low-cost index funds</strong>. You\u2019ll see in a few years that money really does add up. But now it\u2019s your money, not somebody else\u2019s.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information resonates with you, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep working to get you one step closer to financial independence.</p>",
