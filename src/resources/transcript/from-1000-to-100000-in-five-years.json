Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Year 1</h2>\n<p>Contribute <strong>6%</strong> to my 403B to capture the full <strong>6%</strong> match. Add another <strong>$150</strong> a month to my Roth IRA. Total saved: <strong>$11,760</strong> with a <strong>7%</strong> annual return. Year-end balance: <strong>$13,600</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Year 2</h2>\n<p>Same contributions, total saved: <strong>$11,760</strong>. Projected year-end balance: <strong>$27,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Year 3</h2>\n<p>I received a <strong>4% raise</strong> at work, now earning <strong>$86,000</strong>. Bump my 403B contributions to <strong>10%</strong>. Plus the <strong>6%</strong> match, equals <strong>$13,811</strong>. Now contribute <strong>$6,500</strong> to a Roth IRA. Total saved: <strong>$20,311</strong>. Balance at year's end: <strong>$50,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Year 4</h2>\n<p>Same contributions, total saved: <strong>$20,311</strong>. Ending balance: <strong>About $75,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Year 5</h2>\n<p>Another <strong>4% raise</strong> brings my earnings to <strong>$89,000</strong>. Increase my 403B contributions to <strong>12%</strong> plus the <strong>6%</strong> match. That's <strong>$5,386</strong>. Max out my Roth IRA with <strong>$7,000</strong> in 2025. Total saved: <strong>$23,159</strong>. Final balance: <strong>Just over $100,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Did I inherit wealth? No. Did I hit it big on Donkey Coin? No. Did I automate my contributions, get my full employer match, increase my contributions as my paycheck increased, and take advantage of low-cost funds in my 403B and my Roth IRA? Yes. And that’s how I got from <strong>$1,000 to $100,000</strong> in five years on the National Median Household Income.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.
