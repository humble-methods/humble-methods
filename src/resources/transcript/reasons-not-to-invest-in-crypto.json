  "content": "<h1>3 Compelling Reasons to Avoid Investing in Cryptocurrency</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>Reason 1: It's Not an Investment</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, cryptocurrency is not truly an investment. It has <strong>no cash flow</strong> and no underlying physical assets. When your only hope is that someone will buy it for more than you did, that\u2019s known as the <em>greater fool theory</em>, and you might just be the greater fool.</p>\n<h2>Reason 2: It's Not a Store of Value</h2>\n<p>Secondly, consider how you define a store of value. Any asset that can gain or lose <strong>$30,000</strong> of value within a week certainly doesn\u2019t meet my gold standard. This kind of volatility undermines its reliability as a store of value.</p>\n<h2>Reason 3: Correlation with Stocks</h2>\n<p>Finally, cryptocurrency is now almost perfectly positively correlated with stocks. The main reason we diversify our portfolios is to benefit from lower volatility through non-correlated or negatively correlated assets. However, as illustrated in the <strong>2022 market downturn</strong>, stocks and crypto moved in lockstep, adding substantial volatility and risk without providing true diversification.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please <em>like</em> and <em>follow</em>. I'll keep working to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
