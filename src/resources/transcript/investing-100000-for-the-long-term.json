  "content": "<h1>How I Would Invest $100,000 for the Long-Term</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. $20,000 in Individual Stocks</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>$20,000</strong> in individual stocks with <strong>asymmetric upside</strong>. I'm not talking about day trading—I'm referring to those small companies that tend to drive most of the stock market's long-term gains. If you pick solid companies with long-term track records of profitability and hold them for over <strong>30 years</strong>, your upside is truly unlimited while your downside is capped at your initial investment.</p>\n\n<h2>2. $50,000 in an S&P 500 Fund</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>$50,000</strong> in a plain old boring <strong>S&P 500 fund</strong>. It's not sexy, and it never will be. However, over any <strong>20-year</strong> period in history, the S&P 500 has delivered. This fund diversifies across the biggest and most profitable US companies, allowing you to bet on American business and letting time do the heavy lifting.</p>\n\n<h2>3. $30,000 in Private Equity</h2>\n<p>I’d invest the remaining <strong>$30,000</strong> in private equity, only if I truly had a long time horizon. This option carries higher risk, is less liquid, and is certainly less transparent as an investment. You might be locking up your money for years or even decades for the chance at <strong>15% to 20%</strong> returns. Keyword: chance. This strategy is not for everyone, but for high-net-worth individuals with decades ahead of them, it can be a powerful diversifier and is the cornerstone of many long-term portfolios.</p>",
