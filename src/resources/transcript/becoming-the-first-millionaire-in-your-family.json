  "content": "<h1>How to Become the First Millionaire in Your Family</h1>\n<p>If you want to be the first millionaire in your family, you need to do the following three things right now. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Open a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> through <strong>Fidelity</strong>, <strong>Schwab</strong>, or <strong>Vanguard</strong>. It’ll take you just five minutes, and the best part? You can take back your contributions at any time, penalty and tax-free.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Automate Contributions</h2>\n<p>Link your bank account to the Roth and automate funding that account with <strong>$50 a week</strong>. You don’t need more than that to make a big difference in your life.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest Wisely</h2>\n<p>Finally, once the money's in the Roth, invest <strong>100%</strong> of it in a low-cost growth fund, like Vanguard's <strong>VUG</strong> or Invesco's <strong>QQQM</strong>. But as always, do what works for you, as this is just what works for me.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
