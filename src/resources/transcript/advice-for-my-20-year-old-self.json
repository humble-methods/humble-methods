  "content": "<h1>Investing Advice for My Younger Self</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it. If I could go back and talk to my 20-year-old self, here are the three things I'd say to save two decades of mistakes.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest Aggressively in Your 20s</h2>\n<p>Start investing <strong>aggressively</strong> in your 20s and you'll set yourself up for financial success. If you invest just <strong>$500 a month</strong> from age 22 to 32, and then **stop** completely, with a conservative <strong>7% real return</strong>, you'd have around <strong>$1.4 million</strong> by age 65.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Use a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Do your investing in a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. At your young age, you're likely in a lower tax bracket. This means you can pay taxes now and never have to again on your investment gains.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Focus on Action Over Talk</h2>\n<p>It's time to <strong>spend more time doing</strong> and less time talking about doing things. Everyone’s got ideas about launching a podcast, starting a business, or saying \"someday I'll do this.\" Stop talking and start failing forward. It's through trying and failing that you'll learn and grow. The people who ultimately win in their 30s and 40s are those who spent their 20s actively pursuing their goals, not just thinking about them.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
