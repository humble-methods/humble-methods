I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Companies that Shrink or Stumble Get Kicked Out</h2>\n<p>In the S&P 500, underperforming companies are removed, ensuring only strong performers remain.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Thriving Companies Get Overweighted</h2>\n<p>Companies that thrive are given more weight, meaning the index tilts towards what's currently working and winning.</p>\n\n<h2>3. You Benefit Without Predicting</h2>\n<p>With the S&P 500, you get to enjoy the gains without needing to predict a thing, all for about <strong>1/50th</strong> of the price of working with an advisor.</p>",
