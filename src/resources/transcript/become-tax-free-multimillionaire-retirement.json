  "content": "<h1>How to Become a Tax-Free Multimillionaire by Retirement</h1>\n<p>If I were in my 30s, what is the number one thing I would do to become a tax-free multimillionaire by retirement?</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it. Here are my top three strategies:</p>\n<h2>1. Contribute to a Roth 401k</h2>\n<p>I would contribute <strong>$23,000 a year</strong> to a Roth 401k until I retire. Nobody said this would be easy, unless they were selling you some nonsense get-rich-quick scheme.</p>\n<h2>2. Invest in Low-Cost Index Funds</h2>\n<p>Next, I would invest that money in <strong>low-cost index funds</strong>. Once you invest, never look at them again.</p>\n<h2>3. Projected Returns</h2>\n<p>After 30 years, you'd be projected to have about <strong>$2.1 million</strong> of tax-free money. And yes, it will be worth exactly $2.1 million because I've already adjusted for inflation.</p>\n<h2>4. Contribution Limits for Roth 401k</h2>\n<p>No, you do not make too much money to contribute to a Roth 401k, as there are <strong>no income limits</strong> for contributions to a Roth 401k.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
