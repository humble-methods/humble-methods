  "content": "<h1>Five Life-Changing Books That Taught Me More Than My MBA</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Number five:</strong> Dr. Seuss' <em>One Fish, Two Fish</em>. To be a great investor, you only ever need to count to two. One stock index fund, one bond fund.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Number four:</strong> Shel Silverstein's <em>The Giving Tree</em>. Always give more than you take. The sooner you learn to live on less, the better. Don't miss out on what's in front of you, hoping for something that might never happen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Number three:</strong> <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</em>. You don't need to be a great CEO. In fact, you don't even need to be average. As long as you get Hermione Granger to be on your executive team.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Number two:</strong> Margaret Wise Brown's <em>Good Night Moon</em>. The sooner you learn that desire is the root of all emptiness, the better. Cherish the things that are right in front of you starting today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finally:</strong> Wattie Piper's <em>The Little Engine That Could</em>. You are forever and always the only person standing in your way. The problem is, we often judge our own success based on a time frame that is way too short. If we don't succeed within a matter of seconds or minutes, we quit. Set yourself a goal starting today of doing something within one year and don't let yourself quit until that one-year mark. Guarantee you will produce something awesome.</p>",
