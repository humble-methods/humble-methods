  "content": "<h1>The Exact Order I'd Draw Down Money in Retirement</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I create financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Taxable Brokerage First</h2>\n<p>Start with your <strong>taxable brokerage</strong> account. Capital gains tax caps out at <strong>20%</strong>, which is less than many property taxes. Plus, you can access this money at any time without penalties from Uncle Sam.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Social Security and Pensions</h2>\n<p>Next, tap into <strong>social security</strong> and <strong>pensions</strong>. You’ve already paid for them, so now it’s time to get paid back.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Pre-Tax Accounts</h2>\n<p>Only then should you draw from your <strong>pre-tax accounts</strong>. If the government is forcing you to take money out at a certain age, that’s a clue that it’s in your best interest to let it sit and compound for as long as possible. So don't touch a dime of pre-tax accounts before you have to.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Roth IRA Last</h2>\n<p>Finally, leave your <strong>Roth IRA</strong> untouched until the last. These accounts grow tax-free and can pass to the next generation without tax implications, making the IRS sad. This is one of the few instances where there is a right and wrong answer for retirement withdrawal strategies.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
