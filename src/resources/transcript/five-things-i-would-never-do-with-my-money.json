  "content": "<h1>Five Critical Financial Decisions to Avoid as a Former Financial Advisor</h1>\n\n<p>Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, shares five things he would never do with his money.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Avoid Impulse Purchases</h2>\n<p>If I believe I want something, I commit 72 hours to think before buying it. I find that I don't buy 99.9% of the items I thought I needed just 72 hours ago.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Don't Buy Just Because It's on Sale</h2>\n<p>Do not fall for the sale trap! Just because an item is on sale, it doesn\u2019t mean you saved money. Spending on items you don\u2019t need can lead to waste.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Consider Opportunity Cost</h2>\n<p>I would never spend money without considering the opportunity cost. Those $200 shoes cost not just that amount but also what that money could have generated if invested wisely.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Contribute to Your Retirement</h2>\n<p>I never miss putting at least 5% of my paychecks into my retirement plan, particularly in a tax-advantaged account. Prioritize paying yourself first to ensure financial security.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Avoid Credit Card Debt</h2>\n<p>I would never use a credit card to make purchases. If managed poorly, they can become a burden with interest rates as high as 35%, jeopardizing your financial health.</p>\n\n<p>If you found this helpful, like and follow for more tips to bring you closer to your financial goals.</p>",
