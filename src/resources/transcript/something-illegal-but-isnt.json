I don't have to document any of it to the <strong>IRS</strong>. Is this some tax loophole that only the rich know about?</p> <h2>Nope. It's All About the Tax Code!</h2> <p>Taking advantage of <strong>Section 280A</strong> of the U.S. Tax Code. Because I rent out the place to my business partners, it's considered a business expense. But I turn around and write off the <strong>$14,000</strong> on my tax return. The double dip.</p> <h3>You're Learning, Son!</h3> <p>And where did you learn this from? I just follow <strong>Social Cat</strong>. Makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
