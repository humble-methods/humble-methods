  "content": "<h1>A Quick Financial Power Move to Save You Thousands Annually</h1>\n<p>Here is a quick financial power move that will save you thousands of dollars annually. And you're not gonna like it. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free so that you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<p>Before I tell you the move, here are the five ways in which this one move alone has saved me about <strong>$2,648</strong> this year. But who's counting?</p>\n\n<h2>1. Lowering My Phone Bill</h2>\n<p>I took my monthly phone bill from <strong>$89.99</strong> a month to <strong>$39.99</strong> a month.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Reducing Travel Costs</h2>\n<p>I knocked a <strong>$349</strong> round-trip ticket to Miami down to <strong>$156</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Car Payment Reduction</h2>\n<p>I took my car payment from <strong>$500</strong> a month to <strong>$400</strong> a month.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Free Satellite Radio</h2>\n<p>I got the satellite radio in my car from <strong>$14</strong> a month to one year for free. I do love me some Y2 Country.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Better CD Rates</h2>\n<p>I increased my rate of return on a CD over the next 90 days from <strong>2.5%</strong> to <strong>4.5%</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Here\u2019s How You Can Do It</h2>\n<p>Right after you watch this video, call every company with which you're currently doing business\u2014credit card companies, banks, and subscription services\u2014and tell them you're sick and tired of their prices, and you plan to take your business elsewhere. They will immediately offer you a better deal.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re going to say no. They\u2019re most likely going to offer you an even better deal. You\u2019re still going to say no. Ultimately, they will offer you what\u2019s known as their <strong>first-degree discriminatory pricing</strong>. This is where they give you their single best and lowest deal because they realize it costs them way more to lose you as a customer than to give you a deep discount.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not comfortable, but it will make you a stronger negotiator and a more confident consumer. You can take that <strong>$2,500</strong> you save, put it directly into a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>, invest it in <strong>low-cost index funds</strong>, and most likely be a millionaire by retirement.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
