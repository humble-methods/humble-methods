  "content": "<h1>Three Essential Lessons on Money Management</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, the former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content with companies like Facet to show you what the future of financial planning looks like.</p>\n<h2>1. How to Talk to Your Partner About Money</h2>\n<p>We all know how quiet it gets at the dinner table when money comes up, but we need to discuss the things we do not want to talk about. And the earlier, the better.</p>\n<h2>2. Whether You Should Retire Now or Work for a Few More Years</h2>\n<p>Many of us are actually pretty good savers, but few of us feel secure shifting to being spenders after a lifetime of work.</p>\n<h2>3. How to Balance Your Personal Goals with Your Kids' Goals</h2>\n<p>According to the Brookings Institute, it costs about $310,000 to raise a kid until 17. That's a lot of personal sacrifice. I really enjoyed my daily excursions to Jersey Mike's for a number seven with extra bacon. But now I also have to find money to buy my kid yet another backpack after he's lost three of them in the first two weeks of school.</p>\n<p>If you are struggling with any of the above, go to <a href=\"https://facet.com/tyler\">facet.com/tyler</a> today. Let them help you work through these difficult conversations with someone who's not sitting at your dinner table each night.</p>",
