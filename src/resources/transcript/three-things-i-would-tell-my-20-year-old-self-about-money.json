  "content": "<h1>Three Essential Financial Lessons for Your 20-Year-Old Self</h1>\n<p>Hi, I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free to help you navigate your financial journey without any costs.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Avoid Spending More Than You Earn</h2>\n<p>The single biggest mistake with money you will ever make when you're young is <strong>spending more than you earn</strong> by relying on credit cards. Credit card companies can charge you up to <strong>30% interest</strong>, especially for those with low credit scores. Remember, <strong>credit card debt can destroy you financially and emotionally</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Pay Down Debt Immediately</h2>\n<p>The second biggest mistake you can ever make is <strong>not paying down that debt immediately</strong>. Do not invest in any asset or put money in an emergency fund until you have paid down that debt entirely. Think of it this way: paying down high-interest debt is the equivalent of a <strong>30% guaranteed return</strong>. There is no other investment that can guarantee such a return.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest Early with a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Once you're set with the first two rules, do everything you can to start investing <strong>at least $50 a week</strong> in a Roth IRA and low-cost index funds. This is the easiest and laziest way for you to eventually become a millionaire.</p>\n\n<p>If you find any of this information helpful, please <strong>like and follow</strong> for more tips. Together, we can help your younger self get closer to financial success.</p>",
