  "content": "<p>Tyler, yep says here. You're retiring with <strong>13.3 million dollars</strong> in your 401k. Yep. Oh boy!</p>\n<p>So you owe us nothing. Nobody retires with 13 million in a 401k and doesn't owe us something.</p>\n<p>Well, I guess the rules have changed, my friend, because this is a <strong>Roth 401k</strong>.</p>\n<p>Yeah, and we've let you defer those taxes for long enough. No, in a Roth I paid you guys some tax dollars back in the 90s when I wasn't making very much. Then I funded this Roth 401k with my <strong>post-tax dollars</strong> and after 59 and a half I can use that money on whatever I want, whenever I want, <strong>100% tax-free</strong>.</p>\n<p>Well, you better start taking that money out at 72 years old or you're gonna owe us a penalty.</p>\n<p>Well, now you're really gonna hate me. It's a <strong>Roth 401k</strong>. There are no required minimum distributions. It says right here in the rulebook.</p>\n<p>Oh, you must be looking at that rulebook from 2023. Yeah, the rules have changed, my friend: no more RMDs on Roth 401ks. I can just sit back and let that account keep <strong>growing</strong> and growing and growing.</p>",
