Now I create financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Calculate the Tax Hit</h2>\n<p>Before making any moves, calculate the tax hit. Check the cost basis of the fund you want to sell. If you bought it for $50 and it’s now worth $100, you’ll pay capital gains on that $50 profit. Long-term gains, if held over a year, usually incur a 15% to 20% tax rate. However, short-term gains (held for a year or less) are taxed at ordinary income rates, which can be up to 35%. Knowing your tax consequences before acting is crucial.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Tax Loss Harvest to Offset Gains</h2>\n<p>If you're holding a fund that’s currently down, consider selling it. Locking in the losses can help offset any capital gains of equal or lesser value. Additionally, if your losses exceed your gains, you can use up to $3,000 to offset ordinary income. Remember, your losses can carry forward indefinitely until used.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Use New Money Instead of Selling</h2>\n<p>If calculating the taxes from options one and two seems overwhelming, consider this: stop future contributions to the funds you want to exit and redirect those contributions to the funds you prefer. This method allows your portfolio to gradually shift without incurring immediate capital gains taxes.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
