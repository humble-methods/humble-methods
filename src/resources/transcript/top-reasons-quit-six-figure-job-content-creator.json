I'm calling it my retirement.</p><p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I'm unemployed.</p><h2>Reason Number Four: No More Complaining</h2><p>I was done complaining to others, well, mostly myself, that I wasn't getting paid what I was worth. But here's the problem with that statement:</p><blockquote><p>You are forever and always the only person who actually knows what you're worth.</p></blockquote><p>If you really want that six-figure salary, let me let you in on a quick calculation:</p><p>Fifty weeks a year, eight hours a day, five days a week, you just need to come up with a good or service to sell that's worth $400 on the open market. I know you have that within you.</p><p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
