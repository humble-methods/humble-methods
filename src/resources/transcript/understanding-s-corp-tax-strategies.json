I run my LLC as an S-corp and can therefore divide my profits between a W-2 salary, taxed, and a reasonable distribution, less taxed.</p>\n<p>How much less tax?</p>\n<p>Well, I made $200,000 last year as a business. Deduct $50,000 of expenses, $150,000 net, and distribute 50% of that to myself. So I saved $11,475.</p>\n<p>So why don't you just claim it all as a distribution?</p>\n<p>Whoa, you said seems illegal, not is illegal. The IRS loves watching S-corps. You have to make the division between salary and distribution reasonable.</p>\n<p>So what is reasonable?</p>\n<p>Could you pass the salt?</p>",
