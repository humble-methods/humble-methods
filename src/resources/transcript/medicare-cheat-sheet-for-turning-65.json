  "content": "<h1>Medicare Cheat Sheet for Those Turning 65</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Get Your Red, White, and Blue Card</h2>\n<p>Part A, hospital coverage, is free if you've worked for at least 10 years. Part B, which covers medical expenses, costs around $206 a month in 2026 but only covers about 80% of your medical costs.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Add Medicare Supplement Plan G</h2>\n<p>This plan covers the remaining 20% of costs and typically costs about $150 a month. There are no networks or prior authorizations required. You can visit <a href=\"https://ehealth.com\">ehealth.com</a> or <a href=\"https://healthpilot.com\">healthpilot.com</a> to compare different plans.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Consider a Part D Prescription Drug Plan</h2>\n<p>A Part D plan usually costs between $0 to $30 a month, so it's wise to check <a href=\"https://medicare.gov/plan\">medicare.gov/plan</a> to find one that fits your prescription needs.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Utilize SHIP for Counseling</h2>\n<p>If you're feeling confused, look into the State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) in your state. They offer free one-on-one counseling, which is much more helpful than advice from that cousin who thinks they know it all.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Total Monthly Cost</h2>\n<p>Expect total monthly costs to be about $380, along with a $288 annual deductible for the most comprehensive coverage possible. You can also find a local independent Medicare broker at <a href=\"https://nahu.org\">nahu.org</a>, who won’t charge you because they are already paid by insurance companies.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
