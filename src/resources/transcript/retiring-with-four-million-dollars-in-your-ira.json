You now owe us those taxes that we've let you defer until 72. You must be one of the 87,000 new guys. They didn't tell you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I converted.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You did what? When I was 30, my wife and I weren't making very much money. We were in a lower tax bracket, so I converted my traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and took the tax hit then.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So this account is now tax-free?</strong></p>\n\n<p>That's right. But we didn't get that much money from you.</p>\n\n<p>I know. That's why I did it.</p>",
