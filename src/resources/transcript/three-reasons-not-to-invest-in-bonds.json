  "content": "<h1>3 Reasons I'm Not Investing in Bonds, No Matter What</h1>\n<p>Here are three reasons I will never invest in <strong>bonds</strong>, no matter how old I am.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Poor Performance in Inflationary Environments</h2>\n<p>Bonds are terrible investment tools in inflationary environments. Because the return is already locked in, as prices go up and the dollar becomes worth less, my bond returns suffer significantly.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Too Long of a Time Horizon</h2>\n<p>I looked up my predicted lifespan based on my age, health, and family history. If I'm going to make it to <strong>85 years old</strong>, even at a retirement age of <strong>60 to 65</strong>, that gives me a <strong>20-year time horizon</strong> after retirement. I'm not interested in trading long-term growth for short-term stability.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Misunderstanding of Withdrawal Requirements</h2>\n<p>And this one might seem ridiculous, but the world thinks that when you retire, you need to take out all your money. If the stock market has crashed, you\u2019re just screwed. But that\u2019s not how it works. When you retire, you must take what's called a <strong>required minimum distribution</strong> (<strong>RMD</strong>), which typically ends up being about <strong>3% to 5%</strong> of your overall portfolio. So if the market has just crashed <strong>20%</strong>, that\u2019s okay. The majority of my portfolio is going to stay invested, just like it has been throughout most of my life.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
