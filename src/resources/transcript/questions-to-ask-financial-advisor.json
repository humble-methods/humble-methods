  "content": "<h1>5 Essential Questions to Ask Any Financial Advisor Before Hiring Them</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. What Are Your Fees?</h2>\n<p>If they say 1% of assets under management, that equates to <strong>$10,000</strong> a year on a million-dollar portfolio and <strong>$20,000</strong> on a two-million-dollar portfolio. It's a misconception that it's twice as hard to manage a two versus a one. Look for flat fee annual planning and pay only what you really need.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Do You Earn Commissions?</h2>\n<p>If they say yes, you are likely dealing with a salesperson labeling themselves as a financial advisor. They will push products that pay them best, not necessarily what's going to reward you the most.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Are You a Fiduciary?</h2>\n<p>Cool, but remember that Bernie Madoff was also a fiduciary. It's the legal minimum, not a badge of honor.</p>\n\n<h2>4. How Will You Invest My Money?</h2>\n<p>Index funds? You can manage that yourself in about five minutes. Individual stocks? That’s a fool's errand. Actively managed funds run by their friends down the street? Run for the hills.</p>\n\n<h2>5. What Is Your Specialty?</h2>\n<p>Everyone and their cousin seems to be a financial advisor nowadays. The Series 7 is just a driver’s license, not proof of skill. Discuss your exact situation—whether it’s a business sale, divorce settlement, or stock options—and ask for three references from clients who had similar situations.</p>\n\n<p>No specialty? No hire.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
