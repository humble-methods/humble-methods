  "content": "<h1>4 Ways to Contribute Over $100,000 a Year to a Roth IRA</h1>\n<p>Here are four ways in which you can contribute over <strong>$100,000</strong> a year to a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to ensure you have access to valuable information.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>You could take five minutes today to open up a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> through Vanguard, Schwab, or Fidelity. You can contribute up to <strong>$7,000</strong> into that account, invest it in low-cost index funds, and enjoy <strong>30 to 40 years</strong> of compound tax-free growth.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Use the Backdoor Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>If you make too much money to contribute directly to a Roth IRA, first off, congratulations, you\u2019re going to be fine! Just utilize the backdoor. Open a <strong>traditional IRA</strong> through Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard. Make a non-deductible contribution of up to <strong>$7,000</strong> and then convert it to a Roth, as there are no income limits on conversions.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Mega Backdoor Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve already maxed out your IRAs, you can take advantage of the <strong>mega backdoor option</strong>. If you have access to a <strong>401(k)</strong> plan that allows for post-tax contributions, you can contribute up to <strong>$23,000</strong> individually in <strong>2024</strong>. Combined with your employer, you can contribute up to <strong>$69,000</strong>, plus an additional <strong>$7,500</strong> if you're over <strong>50</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Convert Old Accounts</h2>\n<p>Finally, you can always convert any old <strong>401(k)</strong> or traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, as again, there are no income limits on conversions. Remember, you don\u2019t have to do it all at once, because converting triggers a tax event.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
