  "content": "<h1>How I Would Invest $100,000 of Your Money</h1>\n<p>If I were to invest <strong>$100,000</strong> of your money, here is exactly how I would do it. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you make informed investment decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in Low-Cost Index Funds</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>$80,000</strong> directly into a low-cost index fund, such as Fidelity's <strong>FXAIX</strong>. Historically, the S&P 500 has returned around <strong>10%</strong>, or <strong>7%</strong> adjusted for inflation. This investment could turn that <strong>$80,000</strong> into <strong>$323,000</strong> in just the next <strong>20 years</strong>. That\u2019s a quarter of a million dollar return just for having your money sit there. I'll take it!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Diversify the Remaining Investment</h2>\n<p>I would invest the remaining <strong>$20,000</strong> in one of the following options: a bond fund like <strong>BND</strong>, a real estate investment trust like <strong>VNQ</strong>, or a dividend fund like <strong>SCHD</strong>. This diversification moves beyond just growth stocks and provides me with a consistent stream of income.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Celebrate Your Financial Independence</h2>\n<p>Finally, I would take you out for a cup of coffee to celebrate. By doing this on your own, instead of paying an investment advisor <strong>1%</strong> of your assets, we just made you an additional <strong>$100,000</strong> on the stocks and <strong>$8,000</strong> on the fixed income over the next <strong>20 years</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
