  "content": "<h1>How to Become a Tax-Free Millionaire in Just Under 20 Years</h1> <p>Here is exactly how I'd become a tax-free millionaire in just under 20 years.</p> <p><strong>1. Income Overview:</strong> Let's assume my wife and I make <strong>$200,000</strong> a year pre-tax.</p> <p><strong>2. Tax Liability:</strong> We would start by paying close to <strong>$27,000</strong> of taxes. You know, because we're law-abiding citizens.</p> <p><strong>3. Contributions to Roth 401k:</strong> But then we'd have some fun. We would both put <strong>$23,500</strong> into our Roth 401ks.</p> <p><strong>4. Contributions to Roth IRA:</strong> Then we'd both put <strong>$7,000</strong> into our Roth IRAs. Yep, you can do that.</p> <p><strong>5. Disposable Income:</strong> Then we would sit back and relax knowing that we still had <strong>$110,000</strong> of disposable income to fund our monthly date nights to Chili's.</p> <p>And at this rate, we would also most likely have <strong>$2.7 million</strong> waiting for us by age 60, all of which would be <strong>100% tax-free</strong>.</p> <p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
