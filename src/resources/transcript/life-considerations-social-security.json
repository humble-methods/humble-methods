  "content": "<h1>Four Key Life Considerations Before Taking Social Security at 62</h1>\n<p>Even though I still plan on taking my social security at 62 years old, here are four life considerations that might make me change my mind.</p>\n\n<h2>1. My Spouse</h2>\n<p>40% of couples rely on social security for over 50% of their income. By waiting until 66, or full retirement age, my spouse could receive a higher monthly spousal benefit based on my increased monthly payout.</p>\n\n<h2>2. My Life Expectancy</h2>\n<p>The average American is currently projected to die at 79 years old. And my break-even point between taking benefits at 62 versus 66 is 77 years old. But, apparently, if I make it to 65, I also have a 50% chance of living past 85. Go flip a coin, see how you feel.</p>\n\n<h2>3. My Health Needs</h2>\n<p>Even though I can enroll in Medicare at 65, by delaying social security benefits, I have more time to assess my needs. And with healthcare averaging $13,000 a year right now for retirees, that higher annual benefit might end up being crucial.</p>\n\n<h2>4. My Desire to Work or Not to Work After 62</h2>\n<p>If I wanted to keep working after 62, with my benefits being docked $1 for every $2 I earned over $22,320, mathematically it would make more sense to wait until full retirement age or beyond.</p>\n\n<p>But as of right now, I'm still planning on 62. But the above should help you decide what's right for you.</p>",
