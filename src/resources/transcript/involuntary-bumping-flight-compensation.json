  "content": "<p>Sorry, Tyler. We overbooked this flight and we're going to have to involuntarily bump you.</p> <p>Really? Fine. What's my compensation?</p> <p>Uh, a high five and a thanks for your patience?</p> <p>No, I'm talking about money. How much money do I get?</p> <p>Well, it does look like I could actually give you a food voucher.</p> <p>I'll stop you right there. Because you involuntarily bumped me, and the delay is over two hours, you actually have to compensate me 400% of a one-way fare price.</p> <p>One-way fare is 300 bucks, so you owe me 1200 dollars.</p> <p>Aw, that's adorable. Let me guess, you follow some financial gurus on TikTok?</p> <p>Yep, I follow.</p> <p>I'm going to stop you right there. Here in the real world, we don't really care.</p> <p>You see, the amount of time that it's actually going to take you to fill out that paperwork to get the reimbursement? Hmm, let's just say you'd be begging for the food voucher.</p> <p>Now how about you put a smile on your face and go enjoy that Big Mac like everybody else? Will you owe me 1200 next?</p>",
