  "content": "<h1>Why the S&P 500 Might Be the Best Financial Advisor You Never Knew You Had</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. No Need to Pick Winning Companies</h2>\n<p>You don't ever need to worry about picking winning companies because the S&P does it for you. It’s a <strong>market cap weighted index</strong>, quietly shifting your investments towards the most profitable and successful companies.</p>\n\n<h2>2. No Need to Pick Winning Sectors</h2>\n<p>You also don’t need to worry about picking the winning sectors because the S&P does it for you as well. This index shifts your investments towards booming sectors like tech, healthcare, or energy, depending on who’s winning at the time. And if those same sectors aren't winning in a decade, that's okay because you’ll automatically be more invested in whichever ones are performing well.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Offloading the Losers</h2>\n<p>Finally, you don’t need to worry about offloading the losers. If companies don’t live up to certain criteria, they’re out, and a new winner is in. Not only is the S&P 500 way more active than you thought, but it's also about <strong>50 times cheaper</strong> than hiring a financial advisor to pretend to beat it.</p>",
