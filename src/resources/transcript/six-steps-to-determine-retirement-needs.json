  "content": "<h1>6 Steps to Figure Out Exactly How Much Money You'll Need to Retire</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Estimate Your Annual Spending in Retirement</h2>\n<p>Start by estimating your annual spending in retirement. Let's say it's <strong>$80,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Add a Buffer for Inflation</h2>\n<p>Add a <strong>10 to 15%</strong> buffer for inflation, healthcare, and general unpredictability. This brings you up to <strong>$92,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Multiply by 25 for a Conservative Withdrawal Rate</h2>\n<p>Now multiply that number by <strong>25</strong> to conservatively withdraw <strong>4%</strong> of your assets each year in retirement. This equals <strong>$2.3 million</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Opt for a 5% Drawdown</h2>\n<p>If you're comfortable with a <strong>5%</strong> drawdown, which I am, multiply by <strong>20</strong>. This results in <strong>$1.84 million</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Subtract Expected Income</h2>\n<p>Now subtract expected income, like Social Security or pension payments. Say this is <strong>$30,000</strong> a year, or <strong>$600,000</strong> at 5%.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Determine Your Total Retirement Need</h2>\n<p>You now know you need roughly <strong>$1.24 million</strong> to generate your annual expected retirement income.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>And lastly, just remember the famous words of <strong>Mike Tyson</strong>: Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.
