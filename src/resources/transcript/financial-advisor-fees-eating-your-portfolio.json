  "content": "<h1>3 Ways Financial Advisor Fees are Quietly Eating Your Portfolio</h1>\n<p>If this sounds like you, check out my podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Advisory Fees</h2>\n<p>Sure, <strong>1%</strong> may sound small, but it’s not. Over <strong>30 years</strong>, it could eat up <strong>25% to 30%</strong> of your final amount. That’s not just a fee; it’s a slow-motion robbery.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Fund Fees</h2>\n<p>Consider that actively managed mutual fund your advisor is excited about with a <strong>0.75%</strong> expense ratio. Vanguard can do that for <strong>0.03%</strong>. That’s not a rounding error; that’s your vacation home. Well, it’s your advisor’s vacation home now.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Hidden Platform Fees and Commissions</h2>\n<p>Watch out for hidden platform fees, trading costs, and commissions. None of these really ever show up on the statement until you've accidentally built your own private donation fund to your broker's retirement fund. Financial advisors are usually very clear about the fee they charge but egregiously opaque about numbers two and three.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So next time you get your quarterly statement, just make sure you're not funding your advisor's retirement.</p>",
