  "content": "<h1>One Financial Rule I Follow Religiously and One I Don't</h1>\n<p>I’m Tyler, and here’s how I navigate financial rules.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Rule I Follow: Automation</h2>\n<p>I religiously automate everything. This includes my savings, investments, and bills. If it requires discipline, I make it automatic because I don’t have much discipline to spare.</p>\n\n<h2>2. The Rule I Don't Follow: The 50-30-20 Budget</h2>\n<p>The rule I don’t follow is the <strong>50-30-20 budget</strong> or whatever budget ratio you’re pretending to adhere to. While it sounds great in theory, life doesn’t break down into neat percentages. It breaks down into <strong>trade-offs</strong>. For example, <em>Oh, sorry friend, I would have loved to go out with you this week, but I’m already at 21% in that category, so it’ll have to wait until next Tuesday.</em></p>\n\n<h2>3. Focus on Valuing What Matters</h2>\n<p>I’d rather ask myself, <em>What do I value most right now?</em> For me, that might be a haircut, and I’d fund that fully while feeling entitled to spend the rest without guilt.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Just remember, rules can be helpful until they’re not. Use them as tools, not gospel.</p>",
