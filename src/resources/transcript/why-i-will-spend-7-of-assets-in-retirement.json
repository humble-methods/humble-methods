  "content": "<h1>Why I'll Spend 7% of My Assets Per Year in Retirement</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly why I will be spending 7% of my assets per year in retirement. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Reduced Spending</h2>\n<p>According to a <strong>2022 report by the Fed</strong>, retirees spent 2.4% less per year in retirement, indicating that actual spending patterns can be lower than expected.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Investment Retention</h2>\n<p>According to a <strong>2023 study by BlackRock</strong>, retirees had over <strong>80%</strong> of their pre-retirement investments intact after 20 years, showing that it's possible to maintain a significant portion of your wealth throughout retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>3. High Probability of Success</h2>\n<p>The famous <strong>Trinity study of 1998</strong> found that retirees with a starting portfolio of $1 million, who were 100% invested in stocks, and drew down 7% per year had a <strong>96%</strong> chance of being just fine, even with this aggressive withdrawal rate.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Fear of Spending</h2>\n<p>According to <strong>Morningstar</strong>, most retirees are currently only spending <strong>2.8%</strong> of their principal investments per year because they are scared of running out of money. This fear can lead many to unnecessarily underutilize their assets in retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As always, do what works for you. Remember, just because one study found X to be true, we can always find another that finds Y to be true. I choose the study that doesn't have me living in fear throughout my golden years.
