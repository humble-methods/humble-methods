  "content": "<h1>How to Live Off of $2 Million in Retirement Without Running Out of Money</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how I would live off of <strong>$2 million</strong> in retirement without ever running out of money. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, now creating financial content for free.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in a Low-Cost Index Fund</h2>\n<p>Call me crazy, but I would begin by investing all $2 million in a <strong>low-cost index fund</strong> that tracks the S&P 500, like <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VOO\" target=\"_blank\">Vanguard's VOO</a>. By investing in this fund, I would take advantage of its <strong>1.37% annual dividend</strong> and receive about <strong>$35,000</strong> of annual income.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Sell a Percent of Portfolio Annually</h2>\n<p>On January 2nd of each year, I would sell about <strong>3%</strong> of my portfolio to generate another <strong>$65,000</strong> of annual income.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Utilize Social Security Benefits</h2>\n<p>I would net an additional <strong>$20,000</strong> from <strong>Social Security benefits</strong> by adjusting the $33,000 national average to offset about $12,000 owed in taxes each year.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Leave the Remaining Portfolio Intact</h2>\n<p>I wouldn't touch the remaining <strong>97%</strong> of my portfolio. I would let it continue to regenerate and replenish for the rest of my life. With my market returning on average <strong>7%</strong>, adjusted for inflation, I would repeat this process year after year without ever needing to spend any of the original $2 million.</p>\n\n<p>If you find any of this information helpful, please like and follow for more tips as I strive to help you reach your financial goals!</p>",
