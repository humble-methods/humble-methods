  "content": "<h1>Essential Retirement Planning for Women Over 40: 3 Crucial Steps</h1>\n<p>If you are a woman over 40 and you are worried about having enough money to retire, you need to do the following three things right now:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Check Your Social Security Benefits</h2>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://ssa.gov/myaccount\">ssa.gov/myaccount</a> and look at your projected social security benefits during retirement. The average monthly check in 2022 for retired women is $1,550. Can you live on that? Do you want to live on that? If not, we've got some work to do.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Increase Your Retirement Contributions</h2>\n<p>Make sure you are contributing 15% of every one of your paychecks to a Roth IRA or a 401(k). Currently, 42% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved up for retirement. If you are over 50, take advantage of those catch-up clauses: an additional $7,500 for a 401(k) and an additional $1,000 a year for a Roth or traditional IRA.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Ensure Financial Independence</h2>\n<p>Do not ever rely on your partner to take care of you. 80% of women die widowed, which means you will need to be financially independent, whether you are ready or not. So, no waiting. Start today.</p>\n<p>And as always, let me know if you have questions.</p>",
