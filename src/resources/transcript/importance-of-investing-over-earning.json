  "content": "<h1>What They Don’t Teach You in School: The Importance of Investing</h1>\n<p>Here is something they don’t teach you in school. If you earn <strong>$100,000</strong> a year post-tax and invest <strong>$10,000</strong> of that money, you’ll have about <strong>$944,000</strong> in retirement, allowing you to spend about <strong>$40,000</strong> a year post-tax. It’s not great.</p>\n\n<p>But if you make <strong>$80,000</strong> a year and invest <strong>$20,000</strong> of that each year, you’d have <strong>$1.88 million</strong> in retirement and you could spend about <strong>$80,000</strong> a year in retirement, elevating your lifestyle.</p>\n\n<h2>Key Takeaway</h2>\n<p>So just remember, even though they try to teach you in school that you just want to make more money, ultimately, that's irrelevant. What truly matters is that you want to invest more money.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
