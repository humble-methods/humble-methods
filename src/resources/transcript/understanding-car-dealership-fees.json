Title, tags, registration?</p>\n<p>Makes sense. <strong>Documentation fee?</strong> Nope. That fee just makes up for your low-performing salespeople. But it's illegal for us to remove that.</p>\n<p><strong>Correct, but not to negotiate it, so we'll call it a buck.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nitrogen fee?</strong> Nope. I'll get that at Costco.</p>\n<p><strong>Reconditioning fee?</strong> Nope. That should have been already taken care of by the person from whom you bought the used car.</p>\n<p><strong>Destination fee?</strong> Already included in the sticker price.</p>\n<p><strong>Advertising fee?</strong> Also already included in the sticker price.</p>\n<p><strong>Market adjustment fee?</strong> That's it. I'm going to buy a Tesla online. Dealerships still matter.</p>",
