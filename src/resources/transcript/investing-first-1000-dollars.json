  "content": "<h2>Investing Your First $1,000</h2>\n<p>Here's exactly how I would invest my first $1,000 as a former portfolio manager.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Open a Roth IRA</h3>\n<p>Start by opening a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Invest in S&P 500 ETF</h3>\n<p>Next, I would invest <strong>50% of the money</strong> into an <em>S&P 500 ETF</em>. The S&P has not only averaged over <strong>7% per year</strong> in real terms, but it's the foundation of almost every great investor's portfolio, whether they admit it or not.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: High-Growth Satellites</h3>\n<p>Then, I'd invest <strong>30%</strong> into what are known as high-growth satellites, like a <em>tech-heavy ETF</em>. Tech has historically outperformed the broader market, but it is more volatile and carries more risk.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Shoot for the Moon</h3>\n<p>Finally, I'd shoot for the moon with the remaining <strong>20%</strong>. I'd put it in either a <em>small-cap ETF</em>, an <em>emerging markets ETF</em>, or just invest it in single equities that I thought would crush it. Why? Because smaller companies and emerging markets historically have higher growth rates over the long term.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Benefits of This Investment Mix</h3>\n<p>With this mix, I get broad market exposure, low cost, and it's all intelligently placed in a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. And I'm young, most likely in a low tax bracket, and can take advantage of decades of my gains growing <strong>100% tax-free</strong>.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
