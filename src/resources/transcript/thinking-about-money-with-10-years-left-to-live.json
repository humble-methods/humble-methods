  "content": "<h1>How I Would Think About Money If I Had 10 Years Left to Live</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Prioritize Physical Activity</h2>\n<p>Knowing that the average American hits their physical peak in their <strong>30s</strong>, cognitive peak in their <strong>40s</strong>, and orthopedic peak right before rotator cuff surgery in their <strong>50s</strong>, I’d prioritize spending on real physical activity right now.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Stop Saving for an Illusionary Future</h2>\n<p>I'd stop saving for the future like it’s some magical era where time slows down and my hips stop hurting. Newsflash: your future self also has access to email. It won't wait for you!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Balance Cash and Time Wisely</h2>\n<p>Most people are time-rich when they're broke and cash-rich when they're exhausted. That’s not a financial plan; that’s a scheduling error. If you only had <strong>10 summers</strong> left, how would you spend this one? Good. Now go do that right now because it's summertime!</p>",
