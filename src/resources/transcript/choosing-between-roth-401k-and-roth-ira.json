  "content": "<h1>Key Considerations When Choosing Between a Roth 401k and a Roth IRA</h1>\n<p>Here are three things you need to consider if you're choosing between a <strong>Roth 401k</strong> and a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Investment Options</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Roth IRA</strong> typically will give you greater investment options as employers usually have to pay more money with the <strong>401k</strong> plans to get more investment options. So, the 401k can be relatively limited and maybe force you into a fund that costs a little more than you'd like to pay.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Contribution Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>You can't take back contributions to a <strong>Roth 401k</strong> immediately due to the five-year rule. In contrast, you can take back contributions anytime you want, penalty and tax-free from a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Administrative Fees</h2>\n<p>There are also almost always administrative fees for the <strong>Roth 401k</strong>. This is not true for the <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. When working for employers, some employers pay that admin fee. Once you've left that job, the fee falls on you, which can add up quickly. This, combined with the higher fund fees, could equal up to 1%. It\u2019s like hiring a financial advisor just to be in a 401k.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Contribution Limits</h2>\n<p>Even though there are higher contribution limits for the <strong>401k</strong>, it\u2019s always worth checking fees and doing what\u2019s right for you at a certain point in time.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this is helpful; like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
