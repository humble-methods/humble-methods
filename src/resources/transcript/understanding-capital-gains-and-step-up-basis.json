I just called to say thank you.</p>\n<p>Uh, for what?</p>\n<p>For not making me and my family pay any taxes on <strong>$7 million</strong> of lifetime earnings.</p>\n<p>Oh, I mean <strong>capital gains</strong>.</p>\n<p>Oh, yes. Capital gains aren't taxed as highly as regular income, or at all.</p>\n<p>My father just told me that when he dies, he's going to give us his stock portfolio and his house with over <strong>$7 million</strong> of capital gains, and that we won't be taxed on any of it.</p>\n<p>Oh, it\u2019s called <strong>step-up basis</strong>. Anyone can take advantage of that.</p>\n<p>Well, I know you know, because you\u2019re the government, that the <strong>1%</strong> actually holds <strong>50%</strong> of all corporate stock held by Americans. So thank you.</p>\n<p>Where did you learn this?</p>\n<p>I just follow <strong>SocialCap</strong>. He makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
