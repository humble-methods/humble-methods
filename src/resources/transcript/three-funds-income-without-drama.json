  "content": "<h1>Three Funds for Income Without the Drama in Retirement</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. 50% in SCHD</h2>\n<p>Invest in Schwab's US Dividend Equity ETF. This fund contains high-quality companies that mail you checks every quarter. Think Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola—boring, profitable, and reliable. Even in a market downturn, we still enjoy our McDonald's and use our Verizon network.</p>\n\n<h2>2. 30% in BND</h2>\n<p>Consider Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF. When stocks drop 30%, bonds might only drop 10%. And when you're 60 and looking for income, that stability matters.</p>\n\n<h2>3. 20% in VTI</h2>\n<p>Put some money into Vanguard's Total Stock Market ETF because, let’s be real, you're not dying tomorrow. Neither is inflation, so you still need projected growth for the next 30 years.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone tells you investing needs to be more complicated than this, they either don't know what they're talking about or they're just looking to take 1% of your money to place you in funds you don't need—or both.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
