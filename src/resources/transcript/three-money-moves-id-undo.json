  "content": "<h1>3 Money Moves I’d Undo If I Could</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Opening Multiple Bank Accounts</h2>\n<p>I would undo opening <strong>six different bank accounts</strong> to organize my spending. All I did was forget where my money was and which card belonged to which account.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Overconfidence in Individual Stocks</h2>\n<p>Buying individual stocks based on <strong>overconfidence bias</strong> and headlines was a mistake. Spoiler: I didn’t come out ahead.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Delaying Investment for Knowledge</h2>\n<p>Finally, I thought I had to earn the right to invest by learning everything first. You don’t! You should always learn by doing—just start small. Most mistakes aren’t financial; they’re behavioral. But if you learn quickly, they don’t have to be that expensive.</p>",
