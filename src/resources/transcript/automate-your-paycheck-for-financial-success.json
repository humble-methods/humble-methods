  "content": "<h1>Automate These Four Things Before Your Paycheck Hits Your Account</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Contribute to Your 401k</h2>\n<p>Start by allocating <strong>8%</strong> of your paycheck directly to your <strong>401k</strong> if you're a man, and <strong>13%</strong> if you're a woman. Women, on average, spend <strong>11.5 years</strong> out of the workforce compared to <strong>16 months</strong> for men. They also make less on average and live longer, so funding the account with more is crucial.</p>\n\n<h2>2. High-Yield Savings Account</h2>\n<p>Put <strong>2%</strong> in a high-yield savings account or invest it in a money market fund in your brokerage account like Fidelity's <strong>SPAXX</strong>. This provides liquidity and stability, allowing your money to work for you. Right now, both options yield about <strong>4%</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in a Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Another <strong>2%</strong> should be invested in a brokerage account. If you don't have one, open one today through <strong>Vanguard</strong>, <strong>Fidelity</strong>, or <strong>Schwab</strong>. While retirement accounts are great, they’re not the end-all-be-all, and you can't access most of them without penalties until you're <strong>59 and a half</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Health Savings Account</h2>\n<p>Finally, allocate <strong>2%</strong> to a health savings account, if you’re eligible. These accounts are available for people with high-deductible health plans, contributions are tax-deductible, and your money can grow tax-free. Withdrawals are also 100% tax-free for qualifying medical expenses.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Yes, that’s almost <strong>20%</strong> of your paycheck, but you'll now have a 100% better chance of being one step closer to where you need to be. If you found any of this helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
