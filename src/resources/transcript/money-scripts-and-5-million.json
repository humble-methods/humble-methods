  "content": "<h1>Why $5,000,000 Means Nothing If You're Still Reading from Old Money Scripts</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, and here’s the reality: having <strong>$5,000,000</strong> doesn’t guarantee financial peace if you're still trapped in outdated money beliefs.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Flinching at Brand Name Prices</h2>\n<p>You could have <strong>$5,000,000</strong> and still flinch every time you buy brand name cereal. The fear around spending never truly disappears.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Saving Out of Fear</h2>\n<p>You might save obsessively, not because you’re smart, but because your childhood taught you to fear spending. This mindset can keep you in a cycle of financial anxiety.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Money Shame Persists</h2>\n<p>Money shame doesn’t disappear just by adding another zero to your portfolio. It often gets a heck of a lot more expensive. If you don’t rewrite the narrative around money, your wealth will feel a lot like someone else’s.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Get Your Money Guide, on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
