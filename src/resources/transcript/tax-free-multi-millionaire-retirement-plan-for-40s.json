  "content": "<h1>A Six-Step Plan for Tax-Free Multi-Millionaire Retirement in Your 40s</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Calculate Your Combined Income</h2>\n<p>Assume you and your partner make about <strong>$200,000</strong> together, with a post-tax income of <strong>$150,000</strong>. This foundational assumption is crucial for planning purposes.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Contribute to Your Roth 401ks</h2>\n<p>Put <strong>$23,500</strong> each into your Roth 401ks. If you have access to a low-cost growth fund, invest there. With over a 20-year time horizon, this can be beneficial for growth. Don't hesitate to use target date retirement funds if you prefer a bit more safety.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Manage Living Expenses</h2>\n<p>This leaves you with about <strong>$104,000</strong> for living expenses and savings. This amount should feel comfortable and manageable.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Invest in a Taxable Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>For true financial flexibility, I'd invest another <strong>$10,000 to $15,000 a year</strong> in a taxable brokerage account. Use low-cost index funds like <strong>Fidelity's FXAIX</strong> or <strong>Schwab's SWPPX</strong> for these investments.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Projected Growth</h2>\n<p>With an average annual real growth of <strong>6% to 7%</strong>, by age <strong>65</strong>, your Roths could be worth about <strong>$2.9 million</strong>, and the taxable brokerage account around <strong>$632,000</strong>. That’s a combined <strong>$3.5 million</strong>, with about <strong>80%</strong> of it being 100% tax-free after age <strong>59½</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Withdrawal Strategy</h2>\n<p>Finally, I would draw down <strong>6%</strong> per year during retirement, which translates to about <strong>$230,000</strong> annually. This strategy allows you to fund your lifestyle directly from your investments while preserving your principal for your loved ones.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my <strong>free weekly newsletter</strong> by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
