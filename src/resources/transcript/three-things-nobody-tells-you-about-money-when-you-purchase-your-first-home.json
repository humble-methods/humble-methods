  "content": "<h1>Three Crucial Insights About Money for First-Time Homebuyers</h1>\n<p>Here are the three things that nobody tells you about money when you purchase your first home.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Understanding Your Debt-to-Income Ratio</h2>\n<p>Number one, the mortgage officer wasn't just trying to be a complete pain in the butt, even though they were. When they told you that your DTI, <strong>debt to income ratio</strong>, needed to be under <strong>36%</strong>, they were trying to save you from becoming house poor. You should honestly aim for a <strong>25%</strong> or less DTI for your first home.</p>\n<h2>2. Additional Expenses to Consider</h2>\n<p>Number two, what that mortgage officer was also trying to help you realize is that DTI, that 36% of all of your income, it's only just the beginning of what you're gonna pay. Because that doesn't include expenses like <strong>lawn care</strong>, <strong>plowing</strong>, <strong>sewer</strong>, <strong>electric</strong>, <strong>utilities</strong>, <strong>cable</strong>, <strong>internet</strong>, and <strong>maintenance</strong>. So you better work that into your calculations too.</p>\n<h2>3. Prepare for Unexpected Repairs</h2>\n<p>And number three, this is the biggest one you need to remember. Whether it's a leaky faucet, a loose board on a porch, or something wrong with something having to do with electricity. If you can't fix it yourself, expect to pay around <strong>$200</strong> every time someone shows up at your door. So you better have a lot of those $200 bills ready to go.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
