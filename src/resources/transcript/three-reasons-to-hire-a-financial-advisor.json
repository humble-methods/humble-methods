  "content": "<h1>Three Compelling Reasons to Hire a Financial Advisor for Your Investments</h1>\n<p>If I had $1,000,000 to invest today, here are the only three reasons why I would choose to work with a financial advisor.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Save Time and Reduce Stress</h2>\n<p>I didn\u2019t want to spend any of my time thinking about my own money. I would pay someone a flat annual fee, not a percentage of my assets under management, to think and worry about my money for me. Look, I hate worrying about what to cook for dinner each night, so I pay a premium for a meal delivery service and it is worth every penny to me.</p>\n<h2>2. Skip the Learning Curve</h2>\n<p>I didn\u2019t want to learn about any of this investing stuff on my own. Instead of having someone teach me to fish, I would rather have someone just give me the damn fish when it's ready to eat.</p>\n<h2>3. Holistic Financial Wellbeing</h2>\n<p>I found someone who could advise me on my holistic financial wellbeing and not just my investments, taxes, insurance needs, real estate, estate planning, and money psychology. Oh, it\u2019s a thing. Sometimes you need a coach to whisper in your ear that you don\u2019t actually need a brand new boat.</p>\n<p>If you fall into one of those three categories, a financial advisor might be right for you. And if any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
