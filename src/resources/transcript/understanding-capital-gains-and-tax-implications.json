You owe us <strong>$140,000</strong> in taxes.</p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><strong>$50,000</strong> of that is unrealized gains in the stock market. I'm giving that to my daughter when I die.</p>\n<p><strong>$90,000</strong> of that will be directly offset by <strong>$90,000</strong> of losses that I locked in in stocks and then reinvested elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>$500,000</strong> of that is from my wife and me selling our home. That <strong>$60,000</strong> you can\u2019t touch because it\u2019s long-term capital gain.</p>\n<p>And I make under <strong>$41,675</strong> in taxable income a year.</p>\n<p>But plus that $60,000 and you make over <strong>$100,000</strong>.</p>\n<p>No, because I put that <strong>$60,000</strong> directly into my <strong>SEP IRA</strong> because I'm self-employed.</p>\n<p>You have zero capital gains to report?</p>\n<p>Yep.</p>\n<p>Didn\u2019t you write the tax code?</p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t think anyone would actually read it.</p>",
