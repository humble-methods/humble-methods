  "content": "<h1>Achieving Financial Freedom Through Education: My Journey from Teaching to Advising</h1>\n<p>I\u2019m certainly not gonna make any friends in finance for telling you this story, but it happened. It\u2019s ridiculous; I swear it will make you, well, I\u2019ll let you be the judge of that.</p>\n\n<p>But first I\u2019ll tell you really quickly just why I wanted to get into finance in the first place. See, my first real job out of college was as an English teacher. I was an English major; I didn\u2019t exactly have any options as you all know when you finally get your first big kid job. You got to start thinking about big kid things: 401ks, IRAs, 403 Bs, taxes, and like many of you, I knew absolutely nothing because I had never learned any of this in school.</p>\n\n<p>To invest how to invest, what the word invest even means, I did what any good English teacher would do when faced with a real challenge: I sat alone in my apartment and I read a book. That first book blew my mind; I had never known any of this. And I thought, this is it, I\u2019m gonna be a millionaire! I opened up a brokerage account, funded it with 50 bucks, and invested it in a penny stock because my friend told me to. I lost it all. But I didn\u2019t quit. Even though I probably should have, I kept learning, kept reading, and eventually started teaching my colleagues about personal finance. I loved it absolutely loved it.</p>\n\n<p>Then I remembered: hey, isn\u2019t there a job where I actually could do this for a living? Yeah, I could become a financial advisor! Then I could get paid to teach people about finance. Cool, I\u2019m in, sign me up!</p>\n\n<p>There was only one problem. I didn\u2019t have any qualifications or licenses or experience. Turns out, not a problem. Big banks do not care. I called three of the world\u2019s biggest banks and got three interviews within a week.</p>\n\n<p>For my first interview, at let\u2019s just call it Beryl Finch\u2014no, I don\u2019t want to implicate anybody\u2014I got to meet with the vice president. Turns out they\u2019re all vice presidents. I put on my black suit, felt like a ding-dong, holding the VP all about how much passion I had for helping people learn about personal finance. But I also told him I was scared, you know, because I didn\u2019t have any experience; I didn\u2019t think I was smart enough.</p>\n\n<p>And you know what he said? I\u2019m not kidding. He turned to me and said, \u201cTyler, you need a lot of things to be good at this job. Being smart definitely is not one of them.\u201d Huh? I\u2019m sorry, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t need to be smart to help people manage their financial livelihood?\u201d You know, as the financial expert?</p>\n\n<p>Exactly, he said. \u201cThis job is about finding what products people need and selling them those products.\u201d He said, \u201cIn fact,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwe don\u2019t even manage people\u2019s money anymore. You let another firm do that!\u201d What?</p>\n\n<p>So, what would you say you do? I asked. \u201cOur number one job is to bring people through that door and convince them to let us manage their money,\u201d he said with a fine smirk on his face. But you just said you didn\u2019t even manage their money!</p>\n\n<p>Exactly, he cut me off.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s when he asked to see the only document that apparently mattered to him\u2014not my resume, certainly not my personal statement list that they had asked me to create of all the people that I knew, all my personal network, anyone with over a million dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Well, here\u2019s how it ends. I left the interview, and a few days later, they called me, \u201cTyler,\u201d he began, \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re cut out for this job.\u201d I wasn\u2019t surprised; you seem to be more interested in educating people.</p>\n\n<p>Well, turns out they were right, and thankfully, I didn\u2019t spend years of my life selling used car\u2014I mean, financial products! And here\u2019s your takeaway: today\u2019s financial literacy is truly tomorrow\u2019s financial freedom. Keep learning and keep climbing.</p>",
