  "content": "<h1>How I Would Avoid Paying Taxes on 39% of My Income Legally in My 20s</h1>\n<p>If I were in my 20s, here's how I'd avoid paying taxes on about 39% of my income, legally. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Annual Income</h2>\n<p>Let’s say I make <strong>$70,000</strong> a year.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Contribute to a 401(k)</h2>\n<p>I would throw <strong>$23,000</strong> into a <strong>401(k)</strong>. Free company match? Even better! This is a no-brainer for tax savings.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Next, I'd put <strong>$7,000</strong> into a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> and invest it aggressively in a fund like <strong>Vanguard's VUG</strong>. While this is a post-tax account, it will be worth every penny in <strong>40 years</strong> when decades of compound growth result in tax-free withdrawals.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Max Out Health Savings Account (HSA)</h2>\n<p>Then, I’d max out my <strong>health savings account</strong> with <strong>$4,300</strong>, investing it in low-cost index funds. Future me will definitely thank me for this decision!</p>\n\n<h2>5. Utilize Standard Deductions</h2>\n<p>Finally, I'd stack the <strong>single filer deduction</strong>, and I’ve officially dropped from the <strong>22%</strong> to the <strong>12%</strong> marginal tax bracket. This strategy sets me on track to becoming a millionaire in just over <strong>15 years</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week, I'll send you over a money playbook that actually works.</p>",
