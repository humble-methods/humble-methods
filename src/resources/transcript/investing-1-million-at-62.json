  "content": "<h1>How I'd Invest $1 Million If I Retired at 62</h1>\n<p>Here's exactly how I'd invest $1 million if I retired at 62 and lived until 85. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Determine Annual Spending</h2>\n<p>I would first decide what I wanted to spend a year. Let's say <strong>$80,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Calculate Buffer for Unexpected Expenses</h2>\n<p>Multiply that by <strong>1.5</strong>, which gives me <strong>$120,000</strong>. I would stick this amount in <strong>T-bills</strong> for liquidity and safety.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest the Remainder in Stocks</h2>\n<p>The remaining funds now go straight into an <strong>S&P 500 index fund</strong>. Why? Because I'm not going to sacrifice <strong>23 years</strong> of necessary growth for the illusion of principal protection and bonds.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Annual Drawdown Strategy</h2>\n<p>I would draw down <strong>6%</strong> a year by selling stocks from the index fund. That's about <strong>$52,800</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Social Security Benefits</h2>\n<p>Layer on <strong>$2,500</strong> a month from my Social Security at 62, which provides an additional <strong>$30,000</strong> annually.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Total Income</h2>\n<p>In total, I'm pulling in just over <strong>$82,000</strong> a year. Plus, I have <strong>$120,000</strong> in T-bills on the side just in case the market dips or for my low-sodium prune juice and high-stakes contract bridge circuit.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
