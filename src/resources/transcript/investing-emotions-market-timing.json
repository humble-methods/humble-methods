  "content": "<p>Tyler? Yep. It says here you're investing <strong>$1,000 a month</strong> in a brokerage account without reading anything about the stock markets?</p> <p>Yep. Do you invest when the market is overpriced? Yes.</p> <p>Can you invest when there's a recession? Also yes.</p> <p>Isn't that pretty careless? Exactly.</p> <p>What?</p> <p>Well, 99% of the time we're actually our own worst enemy and let our <strong>emotions control our investing decisions</strong>. We tend to buy when the market's overpriced because of <strong>FOMO</strong>. We tend to sell when the market's low because we're terrified we're going to lose it all.</p> <p>But you buy high <strong>AND</strong> you buy low?</p> <p>Oh, I just buy.</p> <p>So you're saying you can't time the market?</p> <p>Oh, I'm saying nobody can. But I can choose to spend a lot of the time in the market and I'm really good at that.</p>",
