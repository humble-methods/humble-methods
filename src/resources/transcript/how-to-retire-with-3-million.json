  "content": "<h1>How to Retire Comfortably with $3 Million</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. In this guide, I will share how I would live off of $3 million in retirement without ever running out of money.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 1: Invest in an Index Fund</h2>\n<p>I would begin by investing <strong>$2 million</strong> in an index fund that tracks the S&P 500, which would yield approximately <strong>$24,000 a year</strong> based on its small dividend of pre-tax income.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 2: Invest in Blue Chip Dividends</h2>\n<p>Next, I would invest <strong>$500,000</strong> in a blue chip dividend stock, aiming for a return of <strong>4% to 5%</strong> per year, generating an additional <strong>$20,000 to $25,000 a year</strong> pre-tax.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 3: Money Market Funds</h2>\n<p>The remaining <strong>$500,000</strong> would be distributed across money market funds, expecting to receive another <strong>$20,000 to $25,000 a year</strong> pre-tax.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 4: Monthly Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>I wouldn't want to live off of only <strong>$75,000 a year</strong>. Therefore, each year on the third day of each month, I would sell <strong>0.5%</strong> of the S&P fund, providing an additional <strong>$10,000 a month</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 5: Dollar Cost Averaging</h2>\n<p>Why sell each month? Statistically, <strong>75% of the time</strong>, markets are higher at year's end than at the beginning. This approach allows me to <strong>dollar cost average</strong> out of my holdings.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 6: Sustainable Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>This strategy would draw down my S&P fund by about <strong>6% per year</strong>, while knowing that the stock market has historically returned <strong>7% per year post-inflation</strong>. This means my principal could continue to appreciate while I lived off of approximately <strong>$200,000 a year</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If you found this information helpful, please <strong>like and follow</strong> for more tips on achieving your financial goals.</p>",
