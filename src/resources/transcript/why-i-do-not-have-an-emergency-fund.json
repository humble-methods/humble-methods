  "content": "<h1>Why I Do Not Have an Emergency Fund</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Low Returns on Savings</h2>\n<p>The average high-yield savings account pays, what, <strong>3%</strong>? You’re earning just enough interest to buy a single banana in <strong>2037</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Most Emergencies Aren't Surprises</h2>\n<p>Most emergencies aren’t actually emergencies. Your car breaking down isn’t some surprise on a random Tuesday; it’s a <strong>2008 Civic</strong>. Think you could have seen that one coming?</p>\n\n<h2>3. Accessibility vs. Fear-Based Hoarding</h2>\n<p>Your emergency fund doesn’t need to be a separate religion. You want to keep <strong>three to six months</strong> accessible? Sure. But the rest of your money should be working much harder. It shouldn't be sitting there wearing a safety vest waiting for some nameless drama that apparently doesn’t take credit cards or offer you net 30 terms.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Emergency funds matter, but fear-based hoarding is not a financial strategy. Plan smart, not scared.</p>",
