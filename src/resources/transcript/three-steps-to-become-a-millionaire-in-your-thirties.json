  "content": "<h1>Three Essential Steps for Women in Their Thirties to Become Millionaires</h1>\n<p>If you’re a woman in your thirties and want to become a millionaire before the finance bro in the office next to you, you need to do the following three things today.</p>\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Commit to Your 401(k)</h2>\n<p>Commit to putting <strong>15%</strong> of your paychecks into a <strong>401(k)</strong>. Men are told to contribute <strong>10%</strong>, but you make less on average, spend 11.5 years out of the workforce to his 16 months, currently have less in your retirement accounts, and on average, live longer. It’s not fair, but it’s the facts.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Now open a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> through <strong>Fidelity</strong>, <strong>Schwab</strong>, or <strong>Vanguard</strong> and commit to funding that account with <strong>$50 a week</strong>, investing it in low-cost growth funds like Vanguard's <strong>VUG</strong> or Invesco's <strong>QQQM</strong>. You now own pieces of the world's most profitable companies, and three decades of potential growth will be <strong>100% tax-free</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Open a Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Finally, open a <strong>brokerage account</strong> through the same firm and contribute and invest another <strong>$50 a week</strong> in low-cost index funds like Vanguard's <strong>VOO</strong> or Fidelity's <strong>FXAIX</strong>. Why contribute to this alongside a 401(k) and a Roth IRA? Because now you have a pre-tax account for tax advantages now, a post-tax account for tax advantages later, and a brokerage account for flexibility and accessibility always. That’s what millionaires do.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
