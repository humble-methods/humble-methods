  "content": "<h1>If I Were in My 20s: Here's How I'd Make My First $100,000</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content to help you achieve your financial goals without the added expense of consulting.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Commit to a Savings Rate</h2>\n<p>The first and foremost step is to commit to a savings rate. I would start with <strong>5% of each paycheck</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Choose Your Savings Account Wisely</h2>\n<p>Next, we need to decide where that <strong>5%</strong> goes. I would choose a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> because I can always withdraw my contributions penalty and tax-free. Plus, it can grow tax-free for decades.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Default to a Money Market Fund</h2>\n<p>To ensure that my money is not sitting idle, I would set the default account in that Roth IRA to a <strong>money market fund</strong>. This way, while I'm researching investment options, my money is still earning interest.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Invest in Growth</h2>\n<p>Next, I would invest that money in something projected to grow at almost double that rate. Personally, I would opt for an <strong>S&amp;P 500 index fund</strong>, which historically returns about <strong>7% post-inflation</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Increase Contributions Annually</h2>\n<p>Finally, each year, I would revisit my savings strategy and do my best to increase my contributions by <strong>1% of my paycheck</strong>. This approach will turbocharge my growth and help evaluate if I need any of that money in the short term to potentially withdraw it from the Roth.</p>\n\n<p>If you found this information helpful, sign up for my free newsletter linked in my bio. Every <strong>Sunday morning</strong>, I'll send you valuable techniques to get you closer to your financial goals.</p>",
