  "content": "<h1>How to Avoid Scams and Fraudulent Investments</h1>\n<p>Please stop scrolling for one minute as this directly impacts every single one of you and your money. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free so you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Verify My Accounts</h2>\n<p>First, I do not have multiple accounts on any platform. I do not have a backup account, a Telegram account, or a Facebook account. <strong>Social Cap on TikTok</strong> and <strong>Social Cap Official on Instagram and YouTube</strong> are my only three accounts.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Communication Protocol</h2>\n<p>I will never follow you, direct message you first, or make contact with you directly in any way. It's not that I don't like you; it's just I don\u2019t do it. So if someone does and is pretending to be me, you can rest assured that it is a scammer trying to steal your money.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Avoid Investment Scams</h2>\n<p>I will never ask you to invest in crypto, Forex trading, or imply that I have some exciting investment opportunity where I can double your money if you just send me some of yours. That\u2019s all a scam. Remember, I gave up my financial licenses, making any solicitation illegal.</p>\n\n<h2>4. How to React to Scam Attempts</h2>\n<p>If someone does reach out to you and pretends to be me, offering you guaranteed returns on something, please report them, block them, and share this information with a friend who might have missed it.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you, and I look forward to continuing to legitimately help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
