  "content": "<h1>How I'd Invest $1,000,000 for Retirement at 62</h1> <p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free so you can avoid unnecessary costs.</p> <h2>Step 1: Determine Annual Spending Needs</h2> <p>First, I would determine exactly what I needed to spend each year. For this example, let\u2019s say it\u2019s <strong>$80,000</strong>.</p> <h2>Step 2: Adjust for Unforeseen Expenses</h2> <p>Next, I\u2019d multiply that number by <strong>1.5</strong> to account for any unforeseen expenses. This means I\u2019d plan to invest <strong>$120,000</strong> in US T-bills. This approach focuses on liquidity and easy access to funds, avoiding mutual fund fees.</p> <h2>Step 3: Invest in Long-Term Growth</h2> <p>After allocating funds for T-bills, I would invest the remainder in an <strong>S&P 500 index fund</strong>. Since I want to live until 85, I cannot afford to sacrifice 23 years of long-term growth in pursuit of principal protection through bonds.</p> <h2>Step 4: Tax-Free Withdrawal Strategy</h2> <p>My withdrawal strategy would involve drawing down <strong>6%</strong> per year, which would net me around <strong>$52,800</strong> of tax-free income due to being in the <strong>0% tax bracket</strong> for capital gains.</p> <h2>Step 5: Social Security Supplement</h2> <p>Additionally, I\u2019d complement my income with <strong>$25,000</strong> from Social Security to maintain an annual income of just under <strong>$80,000</strong> a year. This plan eliminates financial headaches and allows for a stress-free retirement, enjoying activities like high-stakes Mahjong and low-sodium prune juice.</p> <p>If you find any of this helpful, consider signing up for my free newsletter. Every Sunday, I'll send over more thoughts on how to win at Mahjong when you're 80!</p>",
