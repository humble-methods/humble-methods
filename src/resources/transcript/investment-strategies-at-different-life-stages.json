  "content": "<h1>Investment Strategies for Different Life Stages</h1><p>If I were to invest <strong>$100,000</strong> at different points in my life, here is exactly how I would do it. And this is not advice. It's quite literally what I would do. It is not necessarily what you should do.</p><p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p><h2>1. Investing in Your 20s and 30s</h2><p>If I were in my 20s or 30s, I would take on a ton of risk. I would invest <strong>$40,000</strong> in a fund like QQQ, representing 100 of the largest non-financial stocks in the NASDAQ, with a fee of <strong>0.2%</strong>.</p><p>I would invest another <strong>$40,000</strong> in Vanguard's VUG. This is Vanguard's growth ETF, which attracts mostly U.S. growth companies, and it has a very low fee of <strong>0.04%</strong>.</p><p>Finally, I would invest <strong>$20,000</strong> in a fund like IWF that attracts U.S. companies expected to grow more than others, with a reasonable fee of <strong>0.19%</strong>.</p><p>All of these funds are highly volatile, making this strategy best for those with a long time horizon and high risk tolerance.</p><h2>2. Investing in Your 40s and 50s</h2><p>If I were investing in my 40s or 50s, I'd put all <strong>$100,000</strong> into a low-cost index fund that attracts the S&P 500, such as Vanguard's VOO or Fidelity's FXAIX.</p><p>In my 40s or 50s, I still have a relatively long time horizon and want to see decent returns that will sustain me through retirement.</p><h2>3. Investing in Your Late 50s, 60s, and 70s</h2><p>If I were in my late 50s, 60s, or 70s, I'd still invest 100% in stocks. As a highly risk-tolerant individual, I prefer not to invest heavily in bonds but would start to take some risk off the table.</p><p>I would invest <strong>$40,000</strong> in Invesco's SPHD, which tracks companies with relatively high dividends, currently yielding <strong>4.31%</strong> annually, and has lower volatility.</p><p>I would invest another <strong>$40,000</strong> in iShares HDV; it has a slightly lower risk profile, but still offers a healthy annual dividend payout of <strong>3.39%</strong>. Its top holdings include Energy and Big Pharma.</p><p>Lastly, I would invest <strong>$20,000</strong> in Vanguard's VNQ, a real estate income ETF yielding <strong>4.06%</strong> annually, tracking 158 real estate companies that distribute their profits.</p><p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
