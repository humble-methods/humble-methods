  "content": "<h1>Optimizing Retirement Account Withdrawals for Tax Efficiency and Long-Term Growth</h1><p>If I retired at 60 and wanted to optimize withdrawals for my accounts for tax efficiency and long-term growth, here's exactly how I'd do it.</p><p><strong>Hello,</strong> I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p><h2>1. Emergency Fund</h2><p>I would start by ensuring I had an <em>emergency fund</em>. It should be in a liquid account with cash or money market equivalents, providing me with the flexibility to supplement my withdrawals.</p><h2>2. Health Savings Account</h2><p>Next, I'd draw down my <em>health savings account</em> for all my health needs. In my 60s, I'm guessing this will come in handy. All tax-free, all accessible, and I\u2019ve let this one grow uninterrupted since my 30s.</p><h2>3. Roth IRA</h2><p>If I didn't want to leave this one to my beneficiaries or include it in my estate planning, I'd target my <em>Roth IRA</em> next. Withdrawals from this account after age 59 \u00bd are all 100% tax-free, allowing my tax-deferred accounts to continue to grow.</p><h2>4. Brokerage Accounts</h2><p>Next, I\u2019d draw down from my <em>brokerage accounts</em>. While they are taxed, it\u2019s at a much lower rate than ordinary income. I can supplement my annual withdrawals when I'm in a lower tax year.</p><h2>5. Pre-Tax Withdrawals</h2><p>Finally, I'd take those <em>pre-tax withdrawals</em> that I have to take at some point. These are always going to be subject to ordinary income tax. I want to delay these withdrawals as much as possible because, hopefully, I'm spending less and less as I age, which could lead me to lower tax brackets as my go-go years turn into my bingo years.</p><p>If any of this is helpful, <strong>like and follow</strong>, and I'll keep trying to guide you closer to where you need to be.</p>",
