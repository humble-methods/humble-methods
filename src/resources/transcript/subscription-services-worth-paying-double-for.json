  "content": "<h1>Three Subscription Services You Should Pay Double For</h1>\n<p>Here are the three subscription services that I would gladly pay double for. And nope, I'm not being paid by any of these companies to say this. They're just that good.</p>\n<p>Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Peloton</h2>\n<p>I've tried every workout under the sun. Nothing keeps me as consistent as that app. The instructors are authentic, the convenience is game-changing, and the app caters perfectly to my being a raging introvert who is terrified simply of going to the post office to pick up my subscription for.</p>\n<h2>2. AG1</h2>\n<p>Yeah, it's an expensive drink, but I haven't been sick with a cold in two years. You know how long I've been drinking AG1? Two years. And you all see how much I walk outside in the middle of winter in Vermont. And it tastes amazing with just water.</p>\n<h2>3. CookUnity</h2>\n<p>I can cook my own breakfast and dinners, but lunch has always been my weak spot in the middle of a workday. Meal kits? Not in the middle of the day. Takeout? Too expensive. CookUnity? Just right. Delicious, never frozen, outstanding.</p>\n<p>And if any of this is helpful, give me a high five on your next Peloton ride. Keep climbing 22. Find me riding with Matt Wilpers, Allie Love, or Hannah Frankson.</p>",
