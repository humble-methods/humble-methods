  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $2 Million as a Conservative Investor in Your 50s or 60s</h1>\n<p>If I were in my 50s or 60s and had <strong>$2 million</strong> to invest while being a relatively conservative investor but still wanted to take advantage of some potential for growth, here\u2019s how I would allocate my investments. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help guide you in your investing journey.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in Dividend Growth Stocks</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>40% to 50%</strong> of my assets into <strong>dividend growth stocks</strong>. I would probably do this through a fund to diversify my holdings. Not only would I receive annual dividends to provide cash flow, but I would focus on companies that consistently increase their dividends over time. This strategy provides both income and potential for capital appreciation.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Diversify with Bonds</h2>\n<p>I might invest <strong>20% to 30%</strong> of my assets in <strong>U.S. bonds</strong> and <strong>international bonds</strong>. Diversifying my bond holdings would allow access to both emerging and developed market debt, potentially yielding a higher return than U.S. debt. This approach would help mitigate domestic interest rate and currency risk, although it would introduce some political risk and foreign currency risk.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Focus on Utilities or Infrastructure Funds</h2>\n<p>Lastly, I might invest the remaining <strong>20% to 30%</strong> in <strong>utility or infrastructure funds</strong>. These assets provide essential services that often retain their value through various economic cycles. They typically offer lower volatility, with continued potential for capital appreciation.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
