  "content": "<h1>3 Reasons the Roth IRA Might Be the Greatest Gift Congress Will Ever Give You</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Tax-Free Growth</h2>\n<p>If you're in a low-tax bracket, it might make sense to pay the taxes now and let your money grow completely <strong>untaxed</strong> for the rest of your life.</p>\n\n<h2>2. No Required Minimum Distributions</h2>\n<p>You retain control over when and if you touch that money. Contrast that with your <strong>401k</strong> or <strong>traditional IRA</strong>, where the IRS comes knocking at <strong>73</strong> like an old landlord demanding its rent. With a Roth, you get to tell them to piss off and slam the door in their face!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Contribution Flexibility</h2>\n<p>Even though I never want you to take the money out, you can take back contributions from a Roth IRA any time, penalty and tax-free. But you still shouldn't, as life happensâ€”broken HVAC systems happen!</p>",
