  "content": "<h1>Why Index Funds Still Win (Yes, Still)</h1>\n<p>Here is why index funds still win. Yes, still.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Underperformance of Actively Managed Funds</h2>\n<p><strong>90%</strong> of actively managed funds underperform index funds over time. That's not a fluke; that's the system. Notice how you hear this stat over and over again.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Cost-Effectiveness and Simplicity</h2>\n<p>Index funds are cheap, tax-efficient, and boring—just like me wearing the same shirt and saying the same thing every single video. It’s because it works.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Less is More</h2>\n<p>The more trades you make, the more mistakes you make. It’s part math, part psychology. If beating the market is your goal, you’ve already lost. Instead, go buy the whole thing and then go take a walk.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
