  "content": "<h1>The Only Portfolio You Will Ever Need: A No-Nonsense Approach</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)</h2>\n<p>This is every publicly traded US company in one fund with a <strong>0.03% fee</strong>. With VTI, you own shares in major corporations like Apple, Microsoft, and the company that makes those tiny screwdrivers needed to open your iPhone.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS)</h2>\n<p>Because as we saw in 2025, America’s not going to win every year, this fund offers exposure to top companies in Europe, Asia, and emerging markets for a <strong>0.05% fee</strong>. I’ll gladly take that.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)</h2>\n<p>This fund provides stability and encompasses the entire bond market for a low <strong>0.03% fee</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Asset Allocation Formula</h2>\n<p>Now, how much you put in each of these funds depends on you. Here's a formula that works for most people most of the time: <strong>130 minus your age equals the percentage to allocate in stocks.</strong> The remainder should go into bonds. For instance, if you’re 40, then 130 - 40 = 90% to stocks and 10% to bonds. If you’re 70, allocate 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds. This isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach, but it’s a solid guideline.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my <strong>free newsletter</strong> by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
