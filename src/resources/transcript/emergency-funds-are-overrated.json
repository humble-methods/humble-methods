  "content": "<h1>Why Emergency Funds Are 100% Overrated</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Maintenance vs. Emergencies</h2>\n<p>Half the emergencies people plan for are just maintenance in disguise. Needing a new roof is not an emergency; the roof is <strong>35 years old</strong>. That’s called a known expense.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Inflation and Taxes Impacting Returns</h2>\n<p>You’re not earning <strong>4%</strong> on your high-yield savings account. After <strong>3%</strong> gets eaten by inflation and another <strong>1%</strong> by taxes, you’re earning the big <strong>zero</strong>. That's your real emergency!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Cash-Only Crisis Mindset</h2>\n<p>Who in their right mind in this developed world is taking cash only for emergencies? Unless your emergency is that you can't pay the local milkman or your weekly door service, it's called a <strong>net 30 invoice</strong>. Yes, you want cash, but don’t let fear park your money forever. There’s a much smarter way to be safe.</p>",
