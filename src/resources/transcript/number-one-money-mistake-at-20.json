  "content": "<h1>The Number One Money Mistake I Made at 20</h1><p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free to help you avoid costly mistakes.</p><h2>1. The Excitement of Getting My First Credit Card</h2><p>It was thrilling to have my first credit card, allowing me to spend up to $500 of money I didn't have.</p><h2>2. The Surprising First Bill</h2><p>Receiving my first bill was even more exhilarating! I learned that I didn't have to pay back that $500 immediately; I could just make a minimum payment of $17.</p><h2>3. Bragging About My Credit Card</h2><p>I couldn\u2019t help but boast to my friends about how amazing credit cards were!</p><h2>4. The Reality of the Second Bill</h2><p>A month later, receiving my next bill was a rude awakening. Since I had only made the minimum payment, I fell right into the credit card company's trap. They raised my interest rates to 22%.</p><p>Despite paying down my bill to $483, it shot back up to $491. If I had waited another month, I would have exceeded the $500 limit again.</p><h2>5. The Best Money Lesson Learned</h2><p>To this day, this experience provided me with the most valuable financial lesson: never only pay the minimum. Always avoid spending money you don't actually have and, most importantly, pay down high-interest debt first.
