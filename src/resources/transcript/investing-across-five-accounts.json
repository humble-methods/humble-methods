  "content": "<h1>How I Invest Across 5 Different Accounts to Maximize Growth and Minimize Taxes</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how I invest my money across <strong>five different accounts</strong> to maximize growth and minimize taxes. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free so you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Taxable Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>My first account is a <strong>taxable brokerage account</strong>. I use Fidelity and invest <strong>100%</strong> in low-cost index funds like Fidelity's <strong>FXAIX</strong> or Vanguard's <strong>VOO</strong>. Unlike mutual funds, REITs, or dividend stocks, these funds do not distribute annual earnings. As long as I stay invested, I avoid triggering taxes each year and allow my investments to grow uninterrupted.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Next is my <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. Because this account is funded with post-tax dollars, the <strong>30 to 40 years</strong> of compound growth will ultimately be <strong>tax-free</strong>. In this account, I invest in more aggressive funds like <strong>QQQ</strong>. While its historical returns of <strong>13.5%</strong> annually outperform the S&P, it may not be suitable for those who can\u2019t stomach downturns.</p>\n\n<h2>3. SEP IRA</h2>\n<p>My third account is a <strong>SEP IRA</strong>. I contribute the maximum of <strong>25%</strong> of net earnings from my small business, investing <strong>90%</strong> in low-cost index funds and <strong>10%</strong> in real estate investment trusts (REITs). The REITs provide some exposure to real estate, and I can defer taxes on their annual payouts.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Rollover Traditional IRA</h2>\n<p>Next is my <strong>rollover traditional IRA</strong>. This is where I\u2019ve consolidated all of my old <strong>401(k)</strong> accounts, eliminating the risk of forgetting about them and avoiding hefty administrative fees. In this account, I'm <strong>100%</strong> invested in <strong>FXAIX</strong> for simplified management.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Roth 401(k)</h2>\n<p>Finally, my <strong>Roth 401(k)</strong> is where I contribute <strong>15%</strong> of my W-2 income plus a <strong>4%</strong> employer match. Since these accounts are often limited by available funds, I switched away from the default target date retirement fund\u2014which had high fees\u2014to a low-cost option that tracks the S&P 500.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Each strategy is designed to optimize growth and tax efficiency. If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
