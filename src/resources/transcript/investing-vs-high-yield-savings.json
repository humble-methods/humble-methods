  "content": "<h1>Why Women in Their 20s Should Invest Instead of Saving</h1>\n<p>If you're a woman in your 20s and you're currently putting your money into a <strong>high-yield savings account</strong>, earning, I don't know, <strong>5%</strong>, but that money is meant for your long-term goals, I hate to say it, but you're giving up about <strong>a quarter of a million dollars</strong> by not investing that money into a low-cost index fund like Vanguard's <strong>VOO</strong> or Fidelity's <strong>FXAIX</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Here\u2019s the Math</h2>\n<p>If you invest <strong>$250</strong> today and subsequently <strong>$250</strong> every month for the next <strong>30 years</strong> at an average return of <strong>5%</strong>, you\u2019ll end up with about <strong>$209,000</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now, invest that same <strong>$250</strong> today and subsequently <strong>$250</strong> a month for the next <strong>30 years</strong>, but this time earning the historical average of about <strong>10%</strong>. Now you\u2019ll have closer to <strong>$570,000</strong> after 30 years.</p>\n\n<h2>Moral of the Story</h2>\n<p>If you don't need the money now, I guarantee someone else does, and they'll be willing to pay you for the use of it.</p>",
