  "content": "<h1>Essential Financial Tips for Women Before Getting Married</h1>\n<p>If you are a woman considering marriage, there are three crucial actions you need to take immediately:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Start by automating contributions of <strong>$25 to $50</strong> a week. Providers like <strong>Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab,</strong> and <strong>E-Trade</strong> make this process quick and simple, taking as little as five minutes.</p>\n<p>This account can serve as your <em>I'll-be-okay-if-it-hits-the-fan</em> fund. Since your contributions are already taxed, you can withdraw them anytime without penalties or taxes.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Sign a Prenup</h2>\n<p>This step might sound daunting, but it\u2019s essential. While it may feel like you're planning for failure, it's actually a proactive measure to avoid it. Statistics show that <strong>50% of marriages end in divorce</strong>, with money being a leading cause.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t wait until tensions rise to have these conversations. A prenup will help protect you from any debt your partner may have, secure your inheritance, manage business interests, and safeguard your rights as a stay-at-home mom.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest Your Roth IRA Funds</h2>\n<p>Lastly, ensure you are investing those funds inside the Roth IRA. Most of you can benefit from researching <strong>target date retirement funds</strong> and <strong>low-cost index funds</strong>. Prudent investing increases your chances for a secure financial future.</p>\n<p>No one wants to think about failure, but by preparing for it, you can significantly increase your odds of success!</p>",
