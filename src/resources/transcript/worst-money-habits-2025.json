  "content": "<h1>Top 3 Worst Money Habits to Avoid in 2025</h1> <p>Here are the three worst money habits you could take with you into 2025. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p> <h2>1. Paying Yourself Last</h2> <p>This means that when you get your paycheck, you stress out and pay your phone bill, your car bill, your taxes, etc., before committing 10% of that paycheck to a 401k or an IRA.</p> <h2>2. Putting Too Much Money into an Emergency Savings Account</h2> <p>Look, call me a ding-dong who's been in the woods for too long. If you're putting over a few months of cash into a savings account, know that you're sacrificing very real long-term growth for a potential worst-case doomsday scenario.</p> <h2>3. Putting Money into an Emergency Savings Account, Period</h2> <p>Yep, this one's controversial. But with 64% of Americans having no unexpected financial expenses last year, and the remaining 36% having expenses under a thousand bucks, you should consider putting the money in a Roth IRA. You can take back the contributions at any time, penalty and tax-free.</p> <p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
