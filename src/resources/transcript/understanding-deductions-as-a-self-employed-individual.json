I put <strong>$14,000</strong> of that in my <strong>SIMPLE IRA</strong> this year. That shouldn't even be reported as part of my income.</p>\n<p>Deduct another <strong>$10,000</strong> for the mortgage interest I paid on this house.</p>\n<p>And you can deduct another <strong>$10,000</strong> that I made as a charitable contribution. Don\u2019t worry, it was under <strong>50%</strong> of my gross income.</p>\n<p>You can take away another <strong>$1,500</strong> because I worked from home. That\u2019s my <strong>home office deduction</strong>.</p>\n<p>And because my business is a start-up, I spent under <strong>$50,000</strong> in start-up costs, meaning you can deduct another <strong>$5,000</strong> in start-up costs and deduct another <strong>$2,500</strong> in student loan interest because I made under <strong>$70,000</strong> this year.</p>\n<p>Oh, so you were in the <strong>22%</strong> tax bracket. Now you're in the <strong>12%</strong> tax bracket.</p>\n<p>You owe us much less than you thought!</p>",
