  "content": "<h1>How to Make Money When the Stock Market Crashes: Tax Loss Harvesting Explained</h1>\n<p>Here is the number one way that I make a bunch of money when the stock market crashes, as a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I'm Tyler, and I create financial content for free so that you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Market Reaction</h2>\n<p>I wake up and I\u2019m told that the sky is falling.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Portfolio Assessment</h2>\n<p>I look at my portfolio and realize that some of my stocks are worth less than what I bought them for.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Identify Losses</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s say that Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Nvidia are all down big time and are worth <strong>$5,000</strong> less than what I paid for them.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Lock in Losses</h2>\n<p>I\u2019m going to sell those three stocks and lock in a <strong>$5,000 loss</strong> on paper.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Offset Gains</h2>\n<p>Next, I\u2019ll look at other stocks that I bought that are worth significantly more than what I paid. I\u2019ll sell those and lock in a <strong>$5,000 gain</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Tax-Free Gains</h2>\n<p>I\u2019ll call my mom and tell her to be proud because I just locked in <strong>$5,000</strong> of capital gains and will pay <strong>zero taxes</strong> on those gains because the <strong>$5,000</strong> of losses offset those gains.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Stay Invested</h2>\n<p>I\u2019ll keep my mom on the phone and say, \u201cHey mom, you know how I just sold Coke, Nvidia, and Procter & Gamble? Well, I\u2019m immediately going to buy Pepsi, AMD, and Johnson & Johnson.\u201d This way, I remain fully invested.</p>\n\n<h2>8. Additional Losses and Offsetting Income</h2>\n<p>I\u2019ll sell another <strong>$3,000</strong> of stocks that are down to lock in another <strong>$3,000</strong> of losses. I\u2019ll use that <strong>$3,000</strong> to offset <strong>$3,000</strong> of my ordinary taxable income this year.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>My mom will be like, \u201cDid you just teach people about tax-loss harvesting in one minute?\u201d And I\u2019ll say, \u201cNo mom, a minute and ten seconds.\u201d</p>",
