  "content": "<h2>Three Important Lessons About Money and Investing</h2>\n<p>Here are the three things that I would teach my kid about money and investing as a former financial advisor. I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Invest in Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Before you invest one penny in the markets, invest $75 in the following three books:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Malkiel's <i>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</i></li>\n    <li>Ferry's <i>All About Asset Allocation</i></li>\n    <li>Tobias's <i>The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need</i></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>2. Empower Yourself Before Seeking Help</h3>\n<p>Before you invest one penny with a financial advisor, read the three books you just bought. Not only will you know more than 80% of the advisors I know, but congratulations, you just earned an additional guaranteed 2% for the rest of your life because you're not paying them.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Be Wary of Too-Good-to-Be-True Offers</h3>\n<p>Remember that if it sounds too good to be true, I promise you it is. Anyone selling you anything but average is filling your head with nonsense. I want you to be incredibly average, son, just like your dear old dad.</p>\n\n<p>And if any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
