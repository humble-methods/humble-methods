  "content": "<h1>Avoid These 3 Common Financial Mistakes in Your 30s</h1><p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content with companies like Facet to guide you on the future of financial planning.</p><h2>1. Waiting to Invest</h2><p>Many people hesitate to invest because they feel they are not rich enough, smart enough, or old enough. This mindset is fundamentally wrong. For example, investing just <strong>$200 a month</strong> in your 30s, assuming a <strong>7% rate of return</strong>, could grow to <strong>$260,000</strong> by the time you're 60. In contrast, if you wait until your 40s to invest, that same investment could total only about <strong>$112,000</strong> by age 60.</p><h2>2. Lifestyle Creep</h2><p>As you start earning more, it's tempting to spend more. However, just because you can afford a shiny new car doesn\u2019t mean you should lease one to impress your friends. I admit I've been guilty of this with my love for trucks!</p><h2>3. Rushing into Homeownership</h2><p>Be cautious of rushing into buying a home without understanding the full costs involved. The principal and interest of a mortgage is just the beginning. You also need to factor in insurance, taxes, utilities, and maintenance, which can nearly double your monthly costs.</p><p>If you want to avoid making these common mistakes, visit <a href='https://facet.com/tyler'>facet.com/tyler</a> today and connect with their team, eager to guide you through these financial pitfalls.</p>",
