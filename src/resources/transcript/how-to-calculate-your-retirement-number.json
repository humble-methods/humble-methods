  "content": "<h1>How to Calculate Your Retirement Number in Under 60 Seconds</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link on my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. What Will You Spend Per Year?</h2>\n<p>Start by determining what you plan to spend per year. Let's say it's <strong>$70,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Add a Margin of Safety</h2>\n<p>Add a <strong>15%</strong> margin of safety. Call it <strong>$80,500</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Multiply by 20</h2>\n<p>Multiply that number by <strong>20</strong>, because I feel okay spending about <strong>5%</strong> of my assets per year in retirement. This brings us up to <strong>$1.61 million</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Consider Social Security</h2>\n<p>If you have <strong>Social Security</strong>, subtract around <strong>$30,000</strong> a year from your total.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Determine Your Target</h2>\n<p>Reach a target between <strong>$1 million and $1.2 million</strong> that you should have across your brokerage accounts and retirement accounts.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Account for Liabilities</h2>\n<p>And don't forget, this is net debt. Make sure you always account for any liabilities you currently have and try to take care of those before you lose that stable paycheck.</p>",
