I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. You’ve Never Talked About Money</h2>\n<p>You’ve debated city versus country living, having kids versus being DINKs, and whether a hot dog is a sandwich. But heaven forbid you ask if they'd want a joint account or separate accounts!</p>\n\n<h2>2. You Plan to Figure It Out as You Go</h2>\n<p>Fun fact: no, you won’t. Going into a marriage without a plan regarding finances is a recipe for disaster.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Refusing to Sign a Prenup</h2>\n<p>You won't sign a prenup because you don’t want to bring a contract into the marriage. Remember, marriage itself is already a contract! It’s not just about finding the one; it’s about finding the person you still want to have coffee with after they buy a jet ski without discussing it with you.</h2>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
