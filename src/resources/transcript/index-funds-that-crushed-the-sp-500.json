  "content": "<h1>Three Index Funds That Have Crushed the S&P 500 (And Why They Might Not Be Better)</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. QQQ</h2>\n<p>The NASDAQ 100 is up about 125% over the last five years.</p>\n\n<h2>2. VGT</h2>\n<p>Vanguard's Tech Sector ETF has surged around 140% in the same timeframe.</p>\n\n<h2>3. SOXX</h2>\n<p>The Semiconductor ETF has seen nearly 180% growth.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the S&P 500 over the same five years is up only about 85%. But here's what you actually need to know:</p>\n\n<h3>Higher Returns Come With Higher Risk</h3>\n<p>The S&P 500 encompasses companies across all 11 sectors, whereas QQQ contains 100 companies, primarily in the tech sector.</p>\n\n<h3>Past Winners Are Often the Next Decade's Losers</h3>\n<p>In the 2000s, energy stocks dominated, only to falter in the following decade. The best performing sector of the last five years is almost never the top performer of the next five.</p>\n\n<h3>A Better Investment Isn't Always the Highest Return</h3>\n<p>It's about what you can hold through market fluctuations without panic selling. For many, this is the S&P 500. So, next time some ding-dong tells you other funds are better just because they've outperformed, remember the bigger picture.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
