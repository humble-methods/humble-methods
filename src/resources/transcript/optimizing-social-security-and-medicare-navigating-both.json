  "content": "<h1>How to Optimize Navigating Social Security and Medicare Simultaneously</h1>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Understand Eligibility and Enrollment Requirements</h2>\n<p>Enrolling in Medicare during the <strong>initial enrollment period</strong> is crucial. This period begins three months before you turn <strong>65</strong> and extends three months after.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Automatic Enrollment with Social Security</h2>\n<p>If you're already receiving Social Security when you turn <strong>65</strong>, you'll be automatically enrolled in Medicare Part A (hospital coverage) and Part B (outpatient). Part A is usually free, but Part B currently costs <strong>$174</strong> a month, and that premium comes directly out of your Social Security check. If you're still working or have other coverage, enrolling in Part B too early could mean paying for coverage you don't need yet.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Be Aware of Income-Related Adjustments</h2>\n<p>Everyone pays a premium, but higher-income retirees pay more for Part B (outpatient) and Part D (prescriptions). Its impact can be mitigated by smoothing your withdrawals from retirement accounts to help manage your modified adjusted gross income.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>None of this is fun to think about, so I'll leave you with something that is: remember that TikTok kid who talked about how much he loved corn? If that doesn't make you smile, you have no soul.</p>",
