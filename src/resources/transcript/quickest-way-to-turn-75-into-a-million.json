  "content": "<h1>The Quickest Way to Turn $75 into a Million Dollars</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Read 'The Psychology of Money' by Morgan Housel</h2>\n<p>This book will teach you why your brain is often the biggest risk to your portfolio and why it's not about math, but about behavior.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Read 'A Random Walk Down Wall Street' by Burton Malkiel</h2>\n<p>This one shows you why timing the market and stock picking both usually fail, and why simple index investing is the way to go.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Read 'Women With Money' by Jean Chatzky</h2>\n<p>This book unpacks how money ties into identity, freedom, and confidence, especially for women who want to build wealth on their own terms.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
