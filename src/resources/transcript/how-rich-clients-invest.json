  "content": "<h1>How My Richest Clients Invested: Secrets to Worry-Free Wealth</h1>\n<p>Here’s exactly how my richest clients invested and why they never seemed to be worried about money.</p>\n\n<h2>1. No Daily Market Checks</h2>\n<p>They didn’t check the market daily. Instead, they planted money in <strong>broad index funds</strong> and then walked away.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Avoiding Investment Fads</h2>\n<p>They never chased fads or tried to time the tops. Their biggest move? <strong>Rebalancing</strong> their portfolio once a year while enjoying a sandwich.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Temperament Over Strategy</h2>\n<p>Their secret wasn’t just a smart strategy but rather their <strong>temperament</strong>. They didn’t need to feel smart in front of their friends; they just needed to act smart behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
