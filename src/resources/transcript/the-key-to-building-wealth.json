  "content": "<h1>The Key to Building Wealth: Stop Relying on Hope</h1>\n<p>Most people will never build real wealth, not because they don't earn enough, but because they fail to do this one essential thing. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager who creates financial content for free to help you make informed decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. What Rich People Have in Common</h2>\n<p>What do every rich person have in common? They typically own one or more of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n    <li><strong>Businesses</strong>: This includes owning stocks, private companies, or side hustles.</li>\n    <li><strong>Real Estate</strong>: Wealthy individuals often invest in rental properties, land, or real estate investment trusts (REITs).</li>\n    <li><strong>Other Cash-Flowing Investments</strong>: This encompasses dividends, royalties, or other sources of passive income.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>The Average Person's Situation</h2>\n<p>In contrast, the average individual typically works for over 40 years, saves a portion of their income in a bank account, and simply hopes that it will be enough. Rememberâ€”<strong>hope is not a strategy.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>The Actionable Advice</h2>\n<p>So if you do nothing else, start today by buying assets that generate income. Investing in wealth-building avenues is crucial for long-term financial success.</p>\n\n<p>If you find any of this information helpful, hit follow, and I'll keep sharing insights to guide you one step closer to financial independence.</p>",
