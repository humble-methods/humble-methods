  "content": "<h1>Why Early Retirement is Overrated</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Early Autonomy vs. Early Retirement</h2>\n<p>You don’t want early retirement; you want early autonomy. Retiring at <strong>40</strong> sounds cool until you realize your identity was entirely tied to your job. Suddenly, you’re reorganizing your garage for sport. Trust me on this one.</p>\n\n<h2>2. The Nature of Work</h2>\n<p>Most people don’t hate work; they hate meaningless work. So the dream isn’t to stop working; it’s to stop doing things that feel pointless while sitting under fluorescent lighting.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Gradual Retirement Approach</h2>\n<p>You can and should gradually retire a little more each year. Take Fridays off, then take August off, or drop down to <strong>20 hours a week</strong>. The goal isn’t to quit life at <strong>40</strong>, it’s to live a life that doesn’t make you want to escape in the first place.</p>",
