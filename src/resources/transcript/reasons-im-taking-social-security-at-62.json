  "content": "<h1>3 Reasons I’m Taking My Social Security at 62</h1>\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I create financial content for free, so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Gamble of Waiting</h2>\n<p>Many say to wait until <strong>70</strong> to take it. The catch? You’d have to live past <strong>81</strong> just to win. That feels like gambling, and I already lost that kind of bet with my <strong>1995 Subaru Legacy</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Time Left</h2>\n<p>If I make it to <strong>65</strong>, the average man (that’s me, highly average) has about <strong>13 years</strong> left. I’m not interested in saving more money for a future version of me whose new hobby is reorganizing my pill bottle.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Social Security Well</h2>\n<p>Call me a fear mongerer, but that Social Security well isn’t pumping oil forever. It’s projected to run short in <strong>2033</strong>, so you better believe I’m taking it as soon as I can get my Vermont sap-ridden hands on it.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you want to dive deeper, tune into this week's episode of the podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio. We’ll address this topic and all its appropriate nuance head-on.</p>",
