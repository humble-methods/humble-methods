  "content": "<h1>4 Reasons I'm Obsessed with the 529 College Savings Plan</h1>\n<p>Here are the four reasons that I am now officially obsessed with the <strong>529 College Savings Plan</strong>. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you make informed decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Better Investment Options</h2>\n<p>The investment options are way better and cheaper now. You can invest in <strong>low-cost Vanguard</strong> options in most states.</p>\n\n<h2>2. High Contribution Limits</h2>\n<p>You can contribute over <strong>$550,000</strong> in some states, so you never have to worry about whether this account will achieve your goals.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Gift Tax Exclusion Benefits</h2>\n<p>Speaking of funding, we know there\u2019s a <strong>$17,000</strong> gift tax exclusion in <strong>2024</strong>, but what you might not know is that you can elect to put five years' worth of contributions in all at once, per parent. This means you could contribute <strong>$170,000</strong> tax-free into that account the day your child is born, giving it <strong>18 years</strong> to grow tax-free.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Flexible Beneficiary Options</h2>\n<p>Also, you can now roll over up to <strong>$35,000</strong> of unused funds to the beneficiary's <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. But guess what? There\u2019s nothing that says I can\u2019t change that beneficiary to myself, allowing me to avoid Roth income limits for <strong>seven years</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Parental Asset Advantage</h2>\n<p>Unlike the UGMA and the custodial Roth, the <strong>529 plan</strong> is considered a parental asset. When determining financial aid contributions, colleges will usually only expect about <strong>5.64%</strong> of a parental asset, versus <strong>20%</strong> of a child asset.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
