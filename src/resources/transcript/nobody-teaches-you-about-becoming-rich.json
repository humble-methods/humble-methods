It's Not Sexy</h2>\n<p>It won't happen overnight. Anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you a dream and take your money.</p>\n<h2>2. It Is Simple</h2>\n<p>Open a Roth IRA right now. Automate monthly contributions of $50 to $100 to that IRA. Invest in low-cost index funds and don't look at it for 30 years. You'll be all set.</p>\n<h2>3. It's Not Easy</h2>\n<p>You can't live the way that you're living right now. Future consumption requires that you sacrifice current consumption. That's the formula. That\u2019s it.</p>\n<p>If you want to spend it now, that\u2019s great. Just don\u2019t wake up in 10 years and wonder why it\u2019s not there.</p>",
