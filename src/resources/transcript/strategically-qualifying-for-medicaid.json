  "content": "<h1>3 Strategies for Qualifying for Medicaid Without Losing Your Assets</h1>\n<p>If you are looking to strategically qualify for <strong>Medicaid</strong>, even if you earn a lot of money, here are three things you might consider. If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Know Your State's Asset Limits</h2>\n<p>First, understand your specific state’s <strong>asset limits</strong>. The asset limit for Medicaid is around <strong>$2,000</strong> for individuals. However, your primary residence and personal belongings may be exempt from this limit.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Establish a Medicaid Asset Protection Trust</h2>\n<p>Second, consider establishing a <strong>Medicaid Asset Protection Trust</strong> to help protect your assets from being counted towards Medicaid eligibility. Remember, these trusts must be set up at least <strong>five years</strong> before applying to Medicaid, and they are <strong>irrevocable</strong>. This means you can protect your assets for your heirs, but you will lose control and ownership of those assets and their management.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Utilize Spousal Asset Transfers</h2>\n<p>Finally, consider <strong>spousal asset transfers</strong>. If you’re married, transferring assets to a non-applicant spouse can assist in meeting Medicaid’s asset limits. In most cases, assets are considered jointly owned; however, the non-applicant spouse is allowed to retain what's called <strong>Community Spouse Resource Allowance (CSRA)</strong>, which varies by state.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Remember, boys and girls, I am no money expert. I just play one on social media. But if you’re seriously considering any of this, consult a tax attorney near you who specializes in matters that nobody else wants to think about.</p>",
