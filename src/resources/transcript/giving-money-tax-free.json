  "content": "<h1>3 Ways to Give Money Without Paying Taxes</h1>\n<p>Hey Dad, could you tell me three ways you could give me money and avoid paying taxes at the same time?</p>\n<p>Of course, that\u2019s what I do.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Custodial IRA</h2>\n<p>First, I could give you money through a <strong>custodial IRA</strong>. You work for me and put <strong>$6,000</strong> a year into the IRA, and all earnings are <strong>tax-free</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. 529 College Savings Plan</h2>\n<p>Second, we could open a <strong>529 plan</strong>. You can put <strong>$16,000</strong> a year into the account, and so could your mother. There\u2019s no gift tax that way. Alternatively, we could take advantage of the one-time lump sum loophole and put <strong>$160,000</strong> in there right now, and you\u2019d be all set. You just have to use that account for educational expenses.</p>\n\n<h2>3. UGMA Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Finally, we can open you a <strong>UGMA brokerage account</strong>. We could put <strong>$16,000</strong> in there a year, and you don\u2019t even have to work for us. You can spend that money on college, a trip to Europe, your honeymoon, or your wedding. I don't care, as long as it protects our wealth and estate.</p>\n\n<h2>Where Did You Learn About This?</h2>\n<p>Where did you learn about this?</p>\n<p>Just follow <strong>SocialCap</strong>; he makes complex finance seem pretty easy.</p>",
