  "content": "<h1>The Number One Financial Advisor Scam to Avoid</h1>\n<p>Here is the number one financial advisor scam that I have found yet. Even though it sounds great on the surface, it could end up costing you tens of thousands of dollars. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help you navigate your finances.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Temptation of Low Fees</h2>\n<p>This firm tempts you by claiming they'll invest your money in <strong>low-cost index funds</strong>, boasting an ultra-low fee of <strong>0.06%</strong>. That sounds alright.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Assurance Against High Fees</h2>\n<p>Then the firm reassures you that unlike other investment firms, they will not invest your money in mutual funds, which charge higher fees of around <strong>0.59%</strong>. So far, so good.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Service Fee Pitfall</h2>\n<p>Next, they offer to do all of this for you for the super low fee of <strong>0.75%</strong> of your assets. This does beat the industry average of <strong>1%</strong>, potentially saving you tons of money.</p>\n\n<h2>4. The Hidden Cost</h2>\n<p>But if you followed that math, you'll see that you're now effectively paying <strong>0.81%</strong> of your assets to be invested in a low-cost index fund\u2014something that you could do on your own, without their help.</p>\n\n<h2>Take Action</h2>\n<p>Instead of paying 13.5 times the fees, take just 13.5 minutes today. Go to <strong>Bankrate</strong> or <strong>NerdWallet</strong>, type in 'best low-cost index funds of the year,' and treat yourself to a Starbucks latte of your choice because you actually just earned it.</p>",
