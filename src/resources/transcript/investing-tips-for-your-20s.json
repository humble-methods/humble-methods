  "content": "<h1>Three Investing Tips for Your 20s That Will Make You Rich</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Zero Bonds</h2>\n<p>No bonds. You're 20, not 70. Bonds are for people who need their money next Tuesday. If the stock market crashes? Great. Buy more stocks. Buying bonds in your 20s is like ordering oatmeal at a steakhouse; you can do it, but why would you?</p>\n\n<h2>2. Two Funds Max</h2>\n<p>Invest in two funds: <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/vti/overview\">Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI)</a> and a growth fund like <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/vug/overview\">Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG)</a>. With expense ratios under 0.03%, anything higher is essentially throwing money away. Boring wins, boring makes you rich.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Max Out Your Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Do all this in a <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/roth-ira\">Roth IRA</a> and max it out now. At your age, you're likely in the 12% tax bracket, so pay taxes on that chump change today. Withdraw millions at 65, tax-free! Investing $100 a week from age 20 to 65 can equal about $1.5 million in real inflation-adjusted terms. And here's a bonus: if you need money for an emergency, you can pull out the Roth contributions anytime, penalty and tax-free.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
