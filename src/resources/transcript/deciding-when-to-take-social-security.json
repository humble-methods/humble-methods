  "content": "<h1>5 Questions to Determine When to Take Your Social Security Benefits</h1>\n<p>If you are having trouble deciding when to take your Social Security, here are five questions that will help you make the right choice for you. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Just because I'm taking at <strong>62</strong> doesn't mean you should take at <strong>62</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Can You Afford to Wait?</h2>\n<p>Taking benefits at <strong>62</strong> versus your full retirement age of <strong>66 or 67</strong> reduces your benefits on average by <strong>30%</strong> annually. If you can\u2019t afford to wait, then you need to take it earlier.</p>\n\n<h2>2. How Long Do You Expect to Live?</h2>\n<p>No, we don\u2019t have crystal balls, but we need to make an educated guess. The breakeven point for choosing to wait until full retirement age isn\u2019t until <strong>77 years old</strong>. Currently, the average American\u2019s lifespan is around <strong>79 years</strong>. The longer you expect to live past your breakeven point, the more it makes sense to take your benefits later.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Are You Married?</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s stop being selfish for a minute. Waiting to take your own Social Security benefits can lead to an increase in <strong>spousal benefits</strong> in the long run.</p>\n\n<h2>4. How Will This Be Taxed?</h2>\n<p>Go directly to your CPA because I am not one. Remember that up to <strong>85%</strong> of your benefits can be taxed if you exceed a certain income threshold.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Do You Plan on Working Past 62?</h2>\n<p>Starting in <strong>2024</strong>, your benefits can be reduced by up to <strong>$1 for every $2</strong> you make over the income limit of <strong>$22,320</strong>. That's a pretty big hit.</p>\n\n<p>So remember to consider these questions carefully when making your decision about Social Security.</p>",
