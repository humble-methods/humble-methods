  "content": "<h1>Essential Financial Action Steps for Women in Their 30s</h1>\n<p>If you're a woman in your 30s, here are the 3 financial action steps you need to take right now.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Start Investing 15% of Your Paychecks</h2>\n<p>Begin to invest <strong>15%</strong> of each one of your paychecks into a <strong>401k</strong> or a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. Men are often told to put <strong>10%</strong> in, but you'll most likely live <strong>4-6 years longer</strong>, you make <strong>83 cents to his dollar</strong>, and you currently have less, on average, in your retirement accounts. It ain't pretty, but it's true.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in Growth Assets</h2>\n<p>Make sure that at least some of that money is invested in <strong>growth assets</strong>, like a low-cost index fund that tracks the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>. Studies show that women tend to keep more money in cash. While this reduces volatility, it also lowers the potential for long-term growth.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Take Control of Your Finances</h2>\n<p>Never, ever leave it to your partner to control the finances. With <strong>80%</strong> of women dying widowed or divorced, the odds are that at some point you will need direct access to all accounts, usernames, passwords, and investments. Have that conversation now to avoid complications in difficult times.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, <strong>like</strong> and <strong>follow</strong>, and I'll keep trying to guide you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
