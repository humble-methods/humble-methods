  "content": "<h1>3 College Planning Considerations for Your Child</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content with companies like Facet to show you what the future of financial planning looks like.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Rising Costs of College</h2>\n<p>College no longer costs what it did back in the day. We used to pay for textbooks with loose change. Now they finance dorm renovations with hedge funds! The average public school is now around <strong>$24,000</strong> per year, and for private schools, you're looking at about <strong>$46,780</strong> per year. Thatâ€™s before you buy them the hoodie at the bookstore that they'll wear exactly twice.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Generational Debt</h2>\n<p>Without planning, these costs don't just create debt; they create generational debt. This is the kind of debt that politely introduces itself to your child at graduation, then follows them home, sleeps on their couch, and eats their leftovers for the next <strong>20 years</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Available Options</h2>\n<p>You have options: <strong>529 plans</strong>, <strong>UGMA accounts</strong>, custodial <strong>Roth IRAs</strong>. These tools, if used properly, can prevent you or your child from investing a quarter of a million bucks into a degree that may or may not include an elective in medieval pottery.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you'd like to be fully educated on how to pay for their education without having your child live in your basement until further notice, go to <strong>facet.com/tyler</strong> and let them help you build a plan.</p>",
