  "content": "<h1>Top 5 Things to Do Immediately with Your Paycheck to Build Long-Term Wealth</h1>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Pay Off Toxic Debt</h2>\n<p>Do not fund an emergency account. This debt is your emergency. A <strong>5%</strong> gain on a high-yield savings account does not offset a <strong>30%</strong> loss on credit card interest.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Contribute to a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>\n<p>Note, this is not what many call an emergency fund. This fund is for short-term expenses. It's easy to access and can earn <strong>4% to 5%</strong> interest while you figure out what to do with your money.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Contribute to Your 401k Up to the Company Match</h2>\n<p>Wall Street says there's no such thing as a free lunch. Well, they're a bunch of ding-dongs because the <strong>401k match</strong> is literally a free lunch, my friends!</p>\n\n<h2>4. Max Out Your Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>This account grows tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Plus, you never have to take required minimum distributions (RMDs), unlike a traditional IRA. Remember, once the money is in the Roth IRA, you must invest it or else it just sits in cash, earning you the big nothing.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Fund and Invest in a Health Savings Account</h2>\n<p>If you have access to one and are eligible, fund and invest in a <strong>Health Savings Account (HSA)</strong>. It's the only triple-tax-advantaged account in the world, like a turbo-charged retirement account that can help you fund the number one expense in retirement: your health.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, tune in to my new podcast by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
