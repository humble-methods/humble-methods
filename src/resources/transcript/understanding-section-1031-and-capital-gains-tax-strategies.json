Looks like you made $1 million of capital gains from your investment properties.</p>\n<p>So you owe us.</p>\n<p>Nothing!</p>\n<p>But you just sold that property.</p>\n<p>Yep, and I'm reinvesting that money into a new investment property with better cash flow. It's taking advantage of <strong>Section 1031</strong>.</p>\n<p>Well, we'll take our taxes when you sell and don't reinvest.</p>\n<p>Oh, no you won't. See, I'm building a family empire and have those properties in a trust.</p>\n<p>When I die, the capital gains on all of those properties magically disappear.</p>\n<p>Yeah, we should probably revise that part of the tax code.</p>\n<p>Agreed. But until you do, you get nothing.</p>",
