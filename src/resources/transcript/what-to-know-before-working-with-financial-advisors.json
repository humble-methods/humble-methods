  "content": "<h1>A Crucial Lesson Before Working with a Financial Advisor</h1>\n<p>Before you work with that financial advisor, just remember this one thing. I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to empower your financial decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Million Dollar Bet</h2>\n<p>On <strong>January 1st, 2008</strong>, one of the greatest investors of all time, <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>, entered into a <strong>$1 million</strong> bet with Protégé Partners.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Investment Strategy</h2>\n<p>Buffett claimed that he could make more money over the next <strong>10 years</strong> by investing in a <strong>low-cost index fund</strong> than the five hand-picked hedge funds managed by Protégé Partners. These hedge funds utilized whatever high-fee strategies hedge fund managers adopt to impress wealthy clients.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Outcome</h2>\n<p>And we all know what happened next, or at least we should. Buffett won because he understood what I've been preaching for years: <strong>Control costs, invest in low-cost index funds</strong>, full stop.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please sign up for my free newsletter in my bio, and every Sunday morning, I’ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
