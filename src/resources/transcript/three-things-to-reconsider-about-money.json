  "content": "<h1>Three Key Financial Insights</h1>\n<p>Here are three things you might want to reconsider about money. I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Debt is Not Always Bad</h2>\n<p>I'm sorry to all you Dave Ramsey followers, but cheap debt, especially if we can get a better guaranteed return on our money elsewhere, it <strong>is one of the best long-term wealth building tools available</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Home Ownership Isn't Always Good</h2>\n<p>The American dream, I say it's freedom. And the freedom of not having to think about <strong>recurring mortgage payments or deferred maintenance</strong> on your home for the next 30 years, priceless.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Emergency Funds Are Almost Never a Good Idea</h2>\n<p>It's called <strong>cash drag</strong>. You'd usually be better served just investing your money and trying to outpace inflation instead of having your cash sit in some account that's depreciating on a daily basis. Worst comes to worst, you know what usually works in case of an emergency? A credit card.</p>\n\n<p>And if any of this is helpful, like and follow and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
