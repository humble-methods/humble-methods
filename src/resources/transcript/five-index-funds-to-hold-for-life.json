  "content": "<h1>Five Index Funds to Buy and Hold for Life</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. VTI - Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF</h2>\n<p>This is your total US stock market in one click. You get everything from Apple to Microsoft to that tiny company making biodegradable coffee mugs in Oregon. It's your core, your foundation, your financial flannel. Rugged, reliable, and always in style.</p>\n\n<h2>2. QQQM - Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF</h2>\n<p>This tracks the NASDAQ 100, giving you extra exposure to the biggest tech names. Think of it as VTI after three espressos and a new Tesla charger.</p>\n\n<h2>3. VIG - Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF</h2>\n<p>This fund focuses on companies that have increased dividends for at least the last 10 years. These are your financial Subarus. Not flashy, but they'll get you where you need to go through any economic blizzard.</p>\n\n<h2>4. VXUS - Vanguard Total International Stock ETF</h2>\n<p>This is your international fund, giving you exposure to companies outside the US. Because if 2025 taught us anything, it's that you never know what will outperform. Some years, the US leads, some years, Japan, and some years, it's just nice to know you own the entire planet.</p>\n\n<h2>5. SGOV - Short-Term Treasury ETF</h2>\n<p>This fund is currently paying just under 5%. It's where I'd park cash for stability, liquidity, and peace of mind, so I can focus on more important things, like getting my bloodhounds into their Halloween costumes without losing a finger.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
