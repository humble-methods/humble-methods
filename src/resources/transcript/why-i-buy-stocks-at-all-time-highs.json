  "content": "<h1>Why I Buy Stocks at All-Time Highs</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly why I buy stocks at all-time highs. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Historical Returns</h2>\n<p>From <strong>1975 to 2025</strong>, if you bought the S&P 500 at all-time highs, your average one-year return was <strong>13.6%</strong>. But if you bought it at any other time, the average return was only <strong>12.9%</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Two-Year Returns</h2>\n<p>Your two-year return at all-time highs was <strong>27.6%</strong>. At any other time, it was <strong>27.4%</strong>. This shows that buying at peaks still yields significant returns.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Five-Year Returns</h2>\n<p>Your average five-year return at all-time highs was <strong>87.6%</strong>. Comparatively, buying at any other time yielded an average return of <strong>81.9%</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So what's the takeaway? Don't fear the peak. Fear sitting in cash while the market keeps compounding without you. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
