  "content": "<h1>How to Legally Avoid Paying Taxes on 63% of Your Business Revenue</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how I would avoid paying taxes on over <strong>63%</strong> of my business revenue legally. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free so you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Business Revenue Assumption</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s assume my business generated <strong>$400,000</strong> of gross revenue in <strong>2025</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Reinvesting in the Business</h2>\n<p>I would immediately put <strong>$100,000</strong> back into the business to keep it growing, leaving me with <strong>$300,000</strong> net business income.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Self-Employment Tax</h2>\n<p>Assume about <strong>$22,500</strong> is out the door for self-employment tax\u2014bummer.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Contributing to a SEP IRA</h2>\n<p>I open a <strong>SEP IRA</strong> and contribute the max of <strong>$70,000</strong>, which is an above-the-line deduction.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Funding a Health Savings Account</h2>\n<p>Next, I open a <strong>Health Savings Account (HSA)</strong> and put another <strong>$8,550</strong> there, also an above-the-line deduction.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Healthcare Premiums</h2>\n<p>As I\u2019m self-employed, I can also add another <strong>$15,000</strong> of healthcare premiums, which is another above-the-line deduction.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Utilizing the Standard Deduction</h2>\n<p>The cherry on top? I take the old <strong>standard deduction of $30,000</strong> for married filing jointly and inform the government that my taxable income is just <strong>$153,000</strong>. This drops me from the <strong>32%</strong> to the <strong>22%</strong> marginal tax bracket. With this approach, you'll most likely have <strong>$3.1 million</strong> in the SEP IRA within <strong>20 years</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is how we do business.</p>",
