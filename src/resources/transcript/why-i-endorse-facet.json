  "content": "<h1>3 Honest Reasons Why I Partner with Facet</h1>\n<p>Here are three honest and simple reasons why I continue to partner with and endorse <strong>Facet</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>1. No Sales Pitch, No Hidden Fees</h2>\n<p>Facet charges a <strong>flat annual membership fee</strong>. That’s it! No <strong>1%</strong> of your assets, no commissions, and no surprise charges for the privilege of having someone call you buddy while pushing annuities like it’s QVC for retirement products.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Real Planning, Not Fortune Telling</h2>\n<p>Facet helps with the actual stuff that matters: taxes, budgeting, retirement. They don’t pretend to have a crystal ball that tells you what the S&P will do next Tuesday.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Clear Communication</h2>\n<p>Facet's advisors do not try to impress you with fancy terms like <strong>alpha generating exposure</strong> or <strong>tax-optimized glide paths</strong>. They talk like actual people and listen to you. Revolutionary, I know!</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If this sounds like the type of team you’d want on your side, go to <strong>facet.com/tyler</strong> today and find out what separates them from the rest. Even from the woods of Vermont, I know enough about what’s out there to know that this is a good business, providing a good service.</p>",
