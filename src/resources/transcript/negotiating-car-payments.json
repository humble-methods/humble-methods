Oh, no way I can afford $400 a month.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, fine, but don't tell my manager we did this. We can knock it down to <strong>$375 a month</strong> for <strong>39 months</strong>. That way you get to keep the car even longer.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know, $375 is still a little expensive.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, but this is only because I really like you. We're probably losing money on this one.</p>\n\n<p>We can go to <strong>$350 a month</strong> for <strong>36 months</strong> if you just toss in <strong>$2,000 down payment</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I guess that sounds okay. But let me just check the numbers real quick.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, no, you don't need, hey, wait a minute. Even though the monthly kept going down, that just got more expensive for me each time.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, really, we didn't even, now on let's stick to talking <strong>MSRP</strong> and no more of this monthly stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Fine, but how did you know that we shouldn't be talking monthly?</p>\n\n<p>I just follow <strong>Social Cap</strong> because he makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
