  "content": "<h1>The 3 Biggest Myths About Roth IRAs</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create content for free to help you understand your financial options. Here are the three biggest myths about the <strong>Roth IRA</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Everyone Should Open and Contribute</h2>\n<p>The first myth is that you should open and contribute to a Roth IRA no matter what. If anyone ever tells you there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all solution in finance, they\u2019re selling you something. If you're currently in a low tax bracket and believe you'll be in a higher one when you withdraw the money, a Roth can be a great idea. But if your tax situation is flipped, that would be a silly idea.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Income Limits on Contributions</h2>\n<p>The second myth is that there\u2019s an income limit for contributing to a Roth IRA. While it\u2019s true there are income limits for contributing directly to a Roth IRA, there are no income limits for converting to one. You can contribute to a <strong>traditional IRA</strong> and then convert it to a Roth IRA. This means that taxes are now your problem and it\u2019s all solved.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Accessing Your Money</h2>\n<p>The third myth is that you cannot touch the money until you\u2019re <strong>59 and a half</strong>. Any dollar you contribute to a Roth IRA can be taken back at any time, <strong>penalty and tax-free</strong>. It\u2019s only the gains that you can\u2019t touch until age <strong>59 and a half</strong>. And good news\u2014it\u2019s a retirement account, so you shouldn\u2019t want to touch it anyway.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
