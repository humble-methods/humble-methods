  "content": "<h1>Why I Am Taking My Social Security Benefits at 62</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly why I'm going to start taking my social security benefits at 62 years old. I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Life Expectancy</h2>\n<p>I looked up when I'm projected to die. You should really try it. Apparently, I'm going to kick it till I'm 85 years old. Cool.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Break-Even Analysis</h2>\n<p>So I went to <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov\" target=\"_blank\">SSA.gov</a>, set up my account, and saw that if I start taking my money early, at 62, versus taking it at 67, not only will I have access to my money earlier, but the break-even point for those two options, when the annual payouts would finally equal one another, isn't until 77 years old. And if I waited for the delayed payout, the break-even point wouldn't be until 81 years old.</p>\n<p>Not sure I need that extra money when all I'm doing on a daily basis is playing bingo with Fran. I'm not knocking it; it's just not an expensive pastime.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Investing My Benefits</h2>\n<p>Am I taking my benefits at 62? If I don't need the money on a monthly basis, hopefully I won't because I've been following this channel and investing a percentage of my money every paycheck into a 401k. I can just invest the Social Security money too and take advantage of an additional five years of compound growth.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
