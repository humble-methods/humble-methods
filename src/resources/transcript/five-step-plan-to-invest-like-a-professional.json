  "content": "<h1>5-Step Plan to Invest Like a Professional</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Find the Best Financial Advisor</h2>\n<p>Start by finding the best financial advisor or portfolio manager in your area. Remember, we're not just limited to local options anymore since we're in a remote world, and I don’t care what they charge. Bear with me!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest the Minimum Required</h2>\n<p>Give them the absolute minimum amount of money that they will accept to take you on as a client.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Allow Short-Term Management</h2>\n<p>Let them invest your money for one quarter—that’s one fourth of a year.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Document Your Investments</h2>\n<p>When you receive your first quarterly statement, take a picture of the investments.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Break Up and Invest on Your Own</h2>\n<p>Send a breakup letter to your advisor, informing them you're taking your money back and investing on your own. Now you have a professional blueprint for a fraction of the cost of what you would have paid had you continued to invest with them.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
