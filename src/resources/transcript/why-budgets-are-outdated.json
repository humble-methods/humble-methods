  "content": "<h1>Why Budgets Are Outdated and Restrictive</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Budgets Feel Like Diets</h2>\n<p>Budgets make people feel like they're on a diet. Just like diets, most of them collapse in a fit of guilt and Taco Bell.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Design a Cash Flow System</h2>\n<p>What actually works is designing a <strong>cash flow system</strong>. Automate your priorities, set spending ceilings, and let the rest be frictionless.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Avoiding Moral Failures</h2>\n<p>When you treat every purchase like a moral failure, you will burn out quickly. A real system builds in joy and margin, so stop budgeting. Instead, build a system that supports your life rather than policing it.</p>",
