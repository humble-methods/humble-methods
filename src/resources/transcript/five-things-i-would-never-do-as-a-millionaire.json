  "content": "<h1>5 Things I Would Never Do with My Money as a Millionaire</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Avoid Paying High Advisor Fees</h2>\n<p>I would never pay a financial advisor <strong>1%</strong> of my assets to manage my money. For the next 30 years, that fee alone would make my advisor a millionaire.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Don't Invest in What You Don’t Understand</h2>\n<p>I won’t invest in anything I do not fully understand, whether that's private equity markets, annuities, or even, dare I say, crypto. If you don't get it, that's okay. Learn about it before putting money into it.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Avoid Real Estate Without Knowledge</h2>\n<p>I would never invest even one penny into real estate just because some <strong>20-year-old</strong> on social media told me it was a magical million maker via passive income. Real estate can be a great asset class, but if you don't understand how cash flow, valuation models, and leverage work, you have no business investing in it.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Don't Mix Insurance with Investing</h2>\n<p>I won't let some insurance agent convince me they have a zero-risk opportunity when they’re not even licensed to sell investment products in the first place.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Keep Investments Simple</h2>\n<p>I refuse to overcomplicate my investments. Personally, I invest in five index funds and ETFs, and yes, it can be that simple. Ultimately, sometimes the smartest moves you make are the ones you don't make.</p>",
