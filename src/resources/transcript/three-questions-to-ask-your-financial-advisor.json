  "content": "<h1>3 Questions You Should Be Asking Your Financial Advisor</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. What’s the Total Amount I’m Paying to Be Invested with You?</h2>\n<p>Your advisor's fee might be just <strong>1%</strong>. However, the funds they invest in might charge another <strong>0.5% or 1%</strong>, meaning you're effectively paying <strong>1.5% or 2%</strong> in total fees, not mentioning all the transaction fees. No one told you all of this because, well, that would be awkward.</p>\n\n<h2>2. What Am I Getting for This Fee?</h2>\n<p>Ask them what you're receiving in exchange for their fee. If the answer is vague handholding or the occasional free lunch, know this: you're overpaying, and you're the one footing the bill for that lunch.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Can I Replicate Your Plan for Cheaper?</h2>\n<p>Ask yourself if you could replicate their plan for less. The answer is most likely yes. Low-cost index funds and flat-fee advisors exist. You simply have to stop paying your current advisor to avoid mentioning those options.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
