  "content": "<h1>Investing for Stability and Income in Retirement</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Here are five funds I would invest in my 60s if I wanted stability and income:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Schwab's U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD)</h2>\n<p>I would allocate 40% of my portfolio to SCHD. This fund owns high-quality, dividend-paying companies that have consistently made profits for over six consecutive quarters.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Vanguard's Total Bond Market ETF (BND)</h2>\n<p>Next, I would invest 30% in BND. This is your chamomile tea in ETF form. While I’m not particularly fond of bonds or tea, they provide a solid income stabilizer for those looking for security in their 60s.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Vanguard's Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities (VTIP)</h2>\n<p>I'd place 10% in VTIP. This fund protects against inflation, so when your grocery bills unexpectedly double, this investment helps maintain purchasing power.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Vanguard's Real Estate ETF (VNQ)</h2>\n<p>Investing 10% in VNQ gives me exposure to commercial real estate without the hassle of managing tenants or property repairs. This fund pays dividends you can collect.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Vanguard's Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)</h2>\n<p>Finally, I’d allocate the remaining 10% to VTI. Yes, I would have stocks in an income-driven portfolio at 60 because you’re planning for the long haul. With inflation being a reality, some growth is essential to ensure your money lasts.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this resonates with you, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
