  "content": "<h1>Three Essential Steps to Become a Tax-Free Millionaire in Your 20s</h1><p>If you are in your 20s and you want to become a tax-free millionaire, here are the three things you need to do today.</p><h2>1. Start with a Roth 401k or Roth IRA</h2><p>As a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, I encourage you to open either a Roth 401k or a Roth IRA. I\u2019ll explain why in a minute.</p><h2>2. Invest as Much as You Can</h2><p>If you have access to the Roth 401k, invest as much as you can afford. For example, <strong>$1,000 a month at 20 years old equals $2.4 million at 60, tax-free.</strong></p><h2>3. Consider a Roth IRA if 401k is Unavailable</h2><p>If you do not have access to a Roth 401k, open and contribute to a Roth IRA. Putting away <strong>$583 a month at 20 equals $1.2 million at 60, adjusted for inflation.</strong></p><h2>4. Enjoy Tax-Free Withdrawals</h2><p>Because you were smart and contributed to a Roth when you were possibly in the lowest tax bracket of your life, <strong>100% of the money in either the 401k or the IRA is tax-free after age 59 and a half.</strong></p><p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to financial success.</p>",
