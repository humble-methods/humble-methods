  "content": "<h1>3 Quick Ways to Make 12 Times What You're Earning in Your Savings Account</h1>\n<p>If you are looking to make <strong>12 times</strong> what you're currently earning in your savings account, here are three ways to do it in under <strong>10 minutes</strong> with under <strong>$10</strong>. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help guide your investment decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>\n<p>Open and fund a <strong>high-yield savings account</strong>. For instance, <strong>SoFi</strong> is currently offering <strong>4.6%</strong> with no minimum deposit. <strong>American Express</strong> will give you <strong>4.26%</strong> with a <strong>$1</strong> minimum, and <strong>Barclays</strong> will give you <strong>4.35%</strong> with no minimum.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in a Money Market Fund</h2>\n<p>Open a brokerage account with <strong>Fidelity</strong> or <strong>Schwab</strong> and invest that <strong>$10</strong> in a leading <strong>money market fund</strong>. For example, <strong>Vanguard's VMFXX</strong> is currently returning <strong>5.31%</strong>, <strong>Schwab's SWVXX</strong> is at <strong>5.28%</strong>, and <strong>PIMCO's AMAXX</strong> is returning <strong>5.27%</strong>. These funds invest in short-term and relatively safe securities and are accessible in case of emergency.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in a No-Cost Index Fund</h2>\n<p>You could also open a brokerage account with <strong>Vanguard</strong> or <strong>E-Trade</strong>, where you could invest that <strong>$10</strong> in a <strong>no-cost index fund</strong>. <strong>Fidelity's FNILX</strong> currently has <strong>0%</strong> fees, <strong>Vanguard's VOO</strong> has <strong>0.03%</strong> in fees, and <strong>iShare's IVV</strong> is also <strong>0.03%</strong> in fees. This strategy will be about <strong>33 times</strong> cheaper than giving this <strong>$10</strong> a week to a financial advisor and having them invest in the same low-cost index fund for you.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to guide you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
