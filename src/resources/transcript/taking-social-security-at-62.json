  "content": "<h1>Why I'm Taking Social Security at 62: A Financial Perspective</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Understanding My Benefits</h2>\n<p>I just checked SSA.gov. If you haven't done it, it's actually pretty fun! My projected monthly benefit is about <strong>$2,479</strong> if I take it at 62, or <strong>$4,636</strong> if I wait until 70. So, I brewed a cup of coffee, grabbed a pen and paper, and took literally five minutes to do some basic algebra.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Analyzing the Break-Even Point</h2>\n<p>The break-even point—the age at which taking benefits at 70 beats taking them at 62 overall—is 79 years old for me. That’s a significant consideration.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Investing Early Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>But here’s the part no one is talking about: if I take my early checks and don’t just stuff the money under a mattress (or spend it), but instead invest it—even in a moderately conservative investment earning <strong>5%</strong>—the break-even point changes. It becomes <strong>never</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Planning for Longevity</h2>\n<p>So for all of you saying I might live until 100, bring it on! I will always have more money by taking it at 62 and investing it rather than waiting until 70. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
