  "content": "<h1>Why I'm Taking My Social Security at 62: A Solid Case</h1>\n<p>Here is yet another reason why I will be taking my <strong>Social Security</strong> at <strong>62</strong>, and I double dog dare you to challenge me on this one. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help you make educated decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Expected Lifespan</h2>\n<p>I looked up when I'm going to die, and based on my health and family history, I estimate I\u2019ll be around until about <strong>85 years old</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Sacrificing Higher Benefits</h2>\n<p>Now, as many of you have pointed out, by taking it at <strong>62</strong>, I'd sacrifice higher monthly benefits down the road. Got it.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Compound Growth Considerations</h2>\n<p>However, by taking it at <strong>67</strong> or <strong>70</strong>, I\u2019d also sacrifice <strong>5 to 10 years</strong> of compound growth related to those smaller monthly benefits. There\u2019s a reason Einstein called compound interest the <strong>eighth wonder of the world</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Investment Projections</h2>\n<p>By investing my benefits in a basic <strong>low-cost index fund</strong> at age <strong>62</strong>, assuming a <strong>7%</strong> real rate of return, I\u2019m projected to wind up with about <strong>$1.6 million</strong> by age <strong>85</strong>. Conversely, if I wait to take benefits until <strong>67</strong>, I\u2019d wind up with only about <strong>$1.49 million</strong>. If I wait until <strong>70</strong>, it drops to <strong>$1.26 million</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Lifetime Benefits</h2>\n<p>If you're waiting to take your Social Security because someone told you that you'll get higher monthly benefits someday, remember that those benefits might ultimately be much lower over your lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>So I\u2019ll ask again, <strong>who\u2019s coming with me?</strong></p>",
