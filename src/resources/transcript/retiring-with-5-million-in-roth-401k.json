  "content": "<p>Tyler? Yep. Looks like you'll be retiring with <strong>$5 million</strong> in your <strong>Roth 401k</strong>.</p> <p>Yep. Okay, so you'll owe us... <strong>Nothing</strong>.</p> <p>But this is a 401k, you have to owe us something.</p> <p>No, it's a <strong>Roth 401k</strong>. I paid taxes back when I was in a lower tax bracket. Now I just sit back and take advantage of 40 years of <strong>tax-free growth</strong>.</p> <p>You were only allowed to contribute <strong>$6,500</strong> a year.</p> <p>It's a <strong>Roth 401k</strong>. I was allowed to contribute <strong>$22,500</strong> per year plus a <strong>$7,500</strong> catch-up clause after 50. Oh, and my company's <strong>6% match</strong>. Free money.</p> <p>So <strong>$36,000</strong> a year of tax advantages?</p> <p>Yep. How did that turn into <strong>$5 million</strong>? <em>Compound interest, my man. Come on, we've talked about this.</em></p> <p>Well, you still have to take <strong>RMDs</strong> on that Roth because it's a 401k.</p> <p>Not anymore, I don't. Thanks to the <strong>Secure Act 2.0</strong>, I don't ever have to take RMDs on this type of 401k.</p> <p>Well, that's not in my notes. That's why I'm here, helping you get better each and every day.</p> <p>Thank you?</p> <p>You bet. Now run along.</p>",
