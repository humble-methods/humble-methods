  "content": "<h1>What Nobody Teaches You in School About Becoming Rich</h1>\n<p>Here\u2019s what nobody will teach you in school about becoming rich:</p>\n\n<h2>1. It\u2019s Not Sexy</h2>\n<p>It won't happen overnight, and anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you a dream and take your money.</p>\n\n<h2>2. It Is Simple</h2>\n<p>Open a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> right now. Automate monthly contributions of <strong>$50 to $100</strong> to that IRA, invest in low-cost index funds, and don\u2019t look at it for <strong>30 years</strong>. You\u2019ll be all set.</p>\n\n<h2>3. It\u2019s Not Easy</h2>\n<p>You can\u2019t live the way you\u2019re living right now if you want to accumulate wealth. Future consumption requires that you sacrifice current consumption. That\u2019s the formula. That\u2019s it. So if you want to spend it now, that\u2019s great. Just don\u2019t wake up in <strong>10 years</strong> and wonder why it\u2019s not there.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding these principles can help you stay focused on your long-term financial goals. Remember, building wealth is a journey that requires patience and discipline.</p>",
