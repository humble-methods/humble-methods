  "content": "<h1>3 Things to Remember When the Stock Market Crashes</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and if any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Yes, We Have Seen Worse</h2>\n<p>Whatever is going on in your mind, just remember: we have seen worse. The Cuban Missile Crisis, the dot-com bubble, the subprime housing crisis. Say it with me, <strong>we have seen worse</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. The President is Not Going to Destroy Your Retirement Fund</h2>\n<p>Unless you have planned on liquidating your entire retirement portfolio on the one day that we experience some short-term volatility, in which case, that's on you, not our elected officials. Remember, your retirement plan was built to cover the next <strong>20 to 30 years</strong> of your life, aka the tenure of the next three to seven presidents.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Stop Checking Markets Daily</h2>\n<p>And yes, you are a ding-dong if you're checking markets daily as a long-term investor. Best advice—and yes, this is advice—look at your investments once a year. I know you won't, but I know you should!</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for the newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
