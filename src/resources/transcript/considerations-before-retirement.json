  "content": "<h1>3 Important Considerations Before Retiring</h1>\n<p>Here are the three most important things that I would consider before retiring. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you make informed retirement decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Assess Your Retirement Fund</h2>\n<p>Do I have <strong>25 times</strong> the amount of money that I would like to live off of annually in retirement? If so, I know I can usually draw down about <strong>4% or 5%</strong> annually without fearing running out of money.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Diversification of Accounts</h2>\n<p>Do I have that money invested across <strong>diversified accounts</strong>? You heard me\u2014diversified accounts. I would make sure to have a <strong>pre-tax account</strong>, a <strong>post-tax account</strong>, a <strong>health savings account</strong> (if I had access to one), a <strong>taxable brokerage account</strong>, a <strong>high-yield savings account</strong>, and some form of <strong>long-term care</strong>. The name of the game in retirement is <strong>flexibility</strong>, and not just for the hips!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Timing Your Social Security</h2>\n<p>Have I figured out when to take my <strong>Social Security</strong>? This is one of the single biggest decisions I\u2019m going to make. I would ask myself if I'm going to be working past <strong>62</strong>, how long I think I might live, what the tax implications are, and if I have a spouse. The answers to those questions would help me decide the best timing for taking my Social Security benefits.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
