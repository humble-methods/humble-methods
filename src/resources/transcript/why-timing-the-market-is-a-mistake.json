  "content": "<h1>Why Trying to Time the Market Is Like Playing Whack-a-Mole with a Blindfold</h1>\n<p>Here’s why attempting to time the market is futile.</p>\n\n<h2>1. You're Not Faster Than the News</h2>\n<p>The market moves way before the headlines hit your feed. In fact, it moves even before those who write the headlines have time to compose them.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Even Professionals Get It Wrong</h2>\n<p>Even the pros get it wrong—except they have <strong>Bloomberg terminals</strong> and you have Reddit.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Missing the Best Days</h2>\n<p>Every time you jump in or out of the market, you risk missing the <strong>10 best days</strong> of the year, which typically hide in the middle of chaos.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
