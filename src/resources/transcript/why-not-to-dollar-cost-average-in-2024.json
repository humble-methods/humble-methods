  "content": "<h1>3 Reasons Not to Dollar Cost Average a Lump Sum in 2024</h1>\n<p>Here are three reasons why I would not dollar cost average a lump sum of money into the markets in <strong>2024</strong>. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you make informed investment decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Market Statistics Favor Immediate Investment</h2>\n<p>Statistically, the market rises <strong>77%</strong> of the time over a one-year timeframe. Do you really want to bet on the <strong>23%</strong> chance that it\u2019s going to drop? Odds are you\u2019re buying shares down the road that will be more expensive than they are today.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Cash is Depreciating</h2>\n<p>Always remember that any cash on the sidelines is depreciating at a rate of about <strong>3%</strong> per year unless you\u2019re holding it in a <strong>money market fund</strong> or a <strong>high-yield savings account</strong>. Just because it\u2019s not in the markets doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe or a positive store of value.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Psychological Impact of Cash</h2>\n<p>And this one is just personal to me: when I invest my money, I psychologically say goodbye to it for a set period of time. But when I have cash, I can always find some reason to spend it. Unfortunately, it\u2019s usually not for something that builds wealth, but more like, <strong>\u201cDang, I need that new Lululemon gear!\u201d</strong> It\u2019s incredibly comfortable to have cash on hand, and you can\u2019t argue with that.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
