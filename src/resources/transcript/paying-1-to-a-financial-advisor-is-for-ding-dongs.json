  "content": "<h1>Why Paying 1% to a Financial Advisor is for Ding-Dongs</h1>\n<p>Here’s why paying <strong>1%</strong> to a financial advisor is a bad move.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Reducing Your Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>Say you retire with <strong>$1 million</strong> and aim to withdraw <strong>4%</strong> a year, which equals <strong>$40,000</strong>. But the advisor takes <strong>1%</strong> of that, which is <strong>$10,000</strong>. You’re giving up <strong>25%</strong> of what you wanted to spend in retirement for a quarterly email warning you about headwinds.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Long-Term Costs</h2>\n<p>While <strong>1%</strong> may seem small now, over time it can shrink your total returns by <strong>25% to 30%</strong>. That’s essentially a <strong>lake house in Vermont</strong> for your advisor, not you!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Most Advisors Buy Index Funds</h2>\n<p>Most financial advisors just buy index funds anyway, then send you colorful pie charts and PDFs loaded with jargon you probably don’t understand. Paying <strong>1%</strong> to someone is not a retirement plan; it's like giving someone a very lucrative tip for merely breathing near your assets.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, check out my podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, where I go over all of this in far more detail.</p>",
