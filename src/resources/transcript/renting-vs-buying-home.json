Let's examine both sides:</p>\n\n<h2>Renting Benefits</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>I have no down payment.</li>\n    <li>I have no maintenance or repair fees.</li>\n    <li>I have no property taxes.</li>\n    <li>I have access to amenities.</li>\n    <li>I have access to a 30-year fixed mortgage rate in a rising rate environment.</li>\n    <li>I have no liquidity issues when I want to leave.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Buying Drawbacks</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>You have no equity.</li>\n    <li>You have no freedom to modify or improve your house.</li>\n    <li>You have no tax advantages.</li>\n    <li>You have no guarantee that you get to stay.</li>\n    <li>What you have is a long-term liability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In conclusion, while the debate will continue, it's clear that <strong>renting offers flexibility and freedom</strong> that buying may not provide.</p>",
