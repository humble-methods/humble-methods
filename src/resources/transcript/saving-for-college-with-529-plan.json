We contributed another <strong>$16,000</strong> each the day my child turned one.</p>\n<p>This account will be worth just under <strong>$250,000</strong> by the time your child is <strong>18</strong>?</p>\n<p>Yep. Thank you, <strong>compound interest</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Tax Advantages of a 529 Plan</h2>\n<p>Okay, well, we\u2019ll take our gift tax.</p>\n<p>No. Because the contributions were under the <strong>$16,000</strong> max, we don\u2019t owe you anything.</p>\n<p>Okay, but we'll be waiting to tax some of that growth when your child takes it out to use it.</p>\n<p>No. This is a <strong>529 college savings plan</strong>. As long as that money is used for qualifying educational expenses, the growth is <strong>100% tax-free</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Where Did You Learn About This?</h2>\n<p>College.</p>\n<p>For one-fifth the price.</p>",
