  "content": "<h1>Your No-BS Playbook for Retirement in Your 50s</h1>\n<p>If you are in your early 50s and want to retire in your 60s, here's your No BS Playbook. Don’t tell me nobody ever taught you this.</p>\n\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Calculate Your Number</h2>\n<p>First, take what you spend in a year—let's say <strong>$80,000</strong>. Multiply it by <strong>20</strong>. This means <strong>$1.6 million</strong> would be my target nest egg.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Add for Taxes</h2>\n<p>Bump it by about <strong>15%</strong> for taxes, bringing the total to <strong>$1.84 million</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Account for Life's Surprises</h2>\n<p>Now, add another <strong>15%</strong> for life's surprises—calculate downturns, health costs, and other surprise expenses. This takes you to just over <strong>$2.1 million</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Max Out Your 401(k)</h2>\n<p>Start maxing out your <strong>401(k)</strong>. The limit is <strong>$23,000</strong> a year, but once you’re over 50, you get a catch-up bonus of <strong>$7,500</strong> a year. That’s <strong>$30,500</strong> of tax-deferred money every year.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Run a Spending Audit</h2>\n<p>Finally, run a quick spending audit, because every <strong>$1,000</strong> you cut in yearly expenses equals <strong>$20,000</strong> less you need to save. Future you will thank you!</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This is how you retire on time: know your number, plan for punches, max out tax advantages, and run a spending audit. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
