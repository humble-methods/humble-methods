  "content": "<h1>Three Simple Ways to Make Your Child a Multi-Millionaire</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Earn $3,000 a Year Helping Your Business</h2>\n<p>Pay your child <strong>$3,000 a year</strong> to help with your business—think social media, filing, or basic tasks that are age-appropriate. Open a <strong>custodial Roth IRA</strong> for them, and invest it in a growth ETF like Vanguard's <strong>VUG</strong>. If you do this from ages 10 to 18 and then never again, by age 65, they could have around <strong>$3.6 million</strong>, and it's 100% tax-free. They will have contributed just <strong>$27,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Earn $2,000 a Year Working for Themselves</h2>\n<p>Help them earn <strong>$2,000 a year</strong> through self-employment activities like babysitting, lawn mowing, or dog walking. Again, use the custodial Roth IRA and invest in a growth fund like <strong>VUG</strong>. If they do this from age 12 to 18 and then never again, by age 65, they'll have approximately <strong>$1.67 million</strong>, all tax-free. Their total contribution would be <strong>$14,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. First W-2 Job at Age 16</h2>\n<p>If they earn <strong>$3,500 a year</strong> working for someone else, open the same custodial Roth IRA with those earnings. If they only do this for three summers, the <strong>$10,500</strong> they contributed could turn into over <strong>$1 million</strong> by age 65.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, earned income plus a custodial Roth IRA plus time equals millionaire status.
