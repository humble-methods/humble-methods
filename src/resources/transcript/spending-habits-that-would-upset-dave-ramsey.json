  "content": "<h1>3 Spending Habits Most Likely to Upset Dave Ramsey</h1>\n<p>What are the three things you spend money on that would most likely piss off <strong>Dave Ramsey</strong>? I'll go first. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help you manage your finances better.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Brand New Cars</h2>\n<p>I buy <strong>brand new cars</strong>. And I lease them, Dave. I know that every time I lease a brand new car, I\u2019m sacrificing about <strong>$100,000</strong> over the course of my investing career by not putting that money into low-cost index funds. But Dave, here\u2019s the thing\u2014a new car will give me something that a low-cost index fund won\u2019t: <strong>new car smell</strong>. Priceless!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Dinner Delivery Services</h2>\n<p>I also spend on <strong>dinner delivery services</strong> because there is nothing I hate more than going to the grocery store. Why? Well, first, Dave, I\u2019m a raging introvert. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll often find me walking alone in the woods without any friends. Second, when I go to the store, that\u2019s at least <strong>one hour</strong> of my time that I will never get back. I pay about <strong>$90 a week</strong> not only to get four healthy and delicious meals shipped directly to my door but also to reclaim that lost time.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Toys for My Dogs</h2>\n<p>And this, Dave, well, you\u2019re probably going to hate me for admitting this, but I spend about <strong>2%</strong> of every paycheck on the latest, greatest toys for my dogs. Don\u2019t judge me, Dave. I\u2019ve already judged myself for this one. I know that regardless of which monkey kong toy I buy, my dogs will either <strong>eat it within five minutes</strong> and then throw it back up, or <strong>ignore it completely</strong> and focus on the old Coke bottle that\u2019s been lurking under the couch for the last month, just out of reach.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is unhelpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step farther away from where you need to be.</p>",
