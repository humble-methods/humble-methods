  "content": "<h1>Five Essential Tips for Retiring with Two Million Dollars</h1>\n<p>If you are 60 years old and you're about to retire with 2 million bucks, you might want to know these five things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Number One:</strong> You should invest that money in low-cost index funds, which historically return an average of 7% annually. Untouched, that account might appreciate to $15 million within 30 years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Number Two:</strong> If you invest that money through an advisor, and that advisor charges you 1% to manage the money, they might lose an additional 1% a year by placing you in expensive mutual funds and frequently trading your portfolio when unnecessary. This means you would most likely have closer to $8.5 million within the same period.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Number Three:</strong> Learning to invest on your own with low-cost index funds tailored for you and your family can genuinely save you millions of dollars\u2014money that can be spent on your family instead of your advisor's.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
