I\u2019m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help you.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in the S&P 500</h2>\n<p>Invest at least <strong>$500 a month</strong> in the <strong>S&P 500</strong>. Historically, the market returns between <strong>7% and 10%</strong>. If you start at <strong>25</strong> and do this consistently, you can have over <strong>$1 million</strong> by age <strong>55</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Avoid Financing Unnecessary Expenses</h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t finance <strong>dumb stuff</strong>\u2014like car loans, credit card debt, or buy now, pay later traps. That <strong>$600 a month</strong> car payment could cost you <strong>$1.4 million</strong> by age <strong>55</strong>. Guess that car was more expensive than you thought!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Save a Portion of Your Raises</h2>\n<p>When you get a raise at work, immediately put <strong>50%</strong> of that raise towards your investments. Now instead of having <strong>$1.1 million</strong> or <strong>$1.4 million</strong>, you\u2019re looking at well over <strong>$2 million</strong> by age <strong>55</strong>. Then you can buy yourself whatever car you want with the interest on those investments alone.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
