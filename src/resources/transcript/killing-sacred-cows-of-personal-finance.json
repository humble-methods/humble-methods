  "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Here are three sacred cows of personal finance that I'm about to kill. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. You Don't Need an Emergency Fund</h2>\n<p>Three months, six months, 12 monthsâ€” the odds that every single thing in your life goes wrong at once is just about zero. But the odds that you ultimately miss out on way more money down the road by not investing? About 100%.</p>\n<h2>2. You Don't Need to Invest in Bonds, Ever</h2>\n<p>We're living longer, healthier lives. By investing in bonds to protect your principle, you're sacrificing long-term growth that you need. Not to mention, bonds aren't that safe; they'll get annihilated based on inflation or rising interest rates.</p>\n<h2>3. Stop Wasting Energy on 4% Withdrawal Rates in Retirement</h2>\n<p>You need to stop thinking that you can only draw down 4% of your money in retirement. If you want a 96% chance of dying with four times more money than when you retired, reconsider your withdrawal strategy. Personally, I want to spend my money while I'm alive!</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I'm confident this information is helpful. Follow me, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
