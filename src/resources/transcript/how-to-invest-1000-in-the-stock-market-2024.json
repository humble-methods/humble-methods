  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $1,000 in the Stock Market in 2024</h1>\n<p>Here's how I would invest $1,000 in the stock market in 2024 as a former professional portfolio manager and self-made trillionaire.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 1: Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>First, I would open a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. This is where I would do all of my investing, especially if I'm in my 20s or 30s. Why? Because all of your gains are ultimately 100% tax-free after you turn 59 1\u20442, and because you can take back the money that you put in at any time for any reason.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 2: Invest in an Aggressive Growth Fund</h2>\n<p>Second, I would put <strong>$800</strong> of that money into an aggressive growth fund like <strong>Vanguard's VIGAX</strong>. It has fees of <strong>0.05%</strong>, and it invests in high-risk, high-reward companies. For a long-term winning strategy, it's hard to beat.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 3: Invest in Individual Stocks</h2>\n<p>Finally, I would invest the remaining <strong>$200</strong> in <strong>10 individual stocks</strong> that I thought would just crush it going forward. That way, even if I lose nine of those bets, if just one hits big, I avoid paying capital gains taxes on a potential massive win. Just make sure that these individual stocks are not already held in your aggressive growth fund.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>And remember, personal finance is always personal.</p>",
