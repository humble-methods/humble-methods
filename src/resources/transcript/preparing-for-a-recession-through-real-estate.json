Can't tell you how to prepare, but I can tell you how I prepared.</p><h2>Investing in Real Estate</h2><p>Real estate has been my focus. I manage three rental properties, which allows me to benefit significantly from tax write-offs.</p><h2>Tax Deductions</h2><p>I get to write off property taxes, property insurance, and mortgage interest, along with all the expenses that come with running my company, such as advertising, office space, and legal fees.</p><h2>Property Management Strategies</h2><p>When I want to sell one of these properties to invest in a better cash flow property, I simply find a new property within 45 days and close on it within 180 days. I have the bank hold onto my money to take advantage of section 1031.</p><h2>LLC Benefits</h2><p>Additionally, since I manage my rentals under an LLC, my rental income qualifies as business income, allowing me to deduct 20% of that income from my personal tax return.</p><h2>Learning from Experts</h2><p>How do you know all of this? Just follow Social Cat. He makes complex finance seem pretty easy.</p>",
