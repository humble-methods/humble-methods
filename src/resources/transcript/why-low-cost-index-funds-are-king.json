  "content": "<h1>3 Reasons Why Low-Cost Index Funds Are King</h1>\n<p>Here are three reasons why <strong>low-cost index funds</strong> are king. I\u2019m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to guide your investment journey.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Control the Costs</h2>\n<p>In investing, we control what we can control, and index funds have the <strong>lowest fees</strong> in the industry. You can find funds for less than <strong>0.1%</strong> annually, which means more of your money stays invested and working for you.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Built-In Diversification</h2>\n<p>Index funds offer built-in diversification, containing hundreds to thousands of stocks within one fund. While this doesn\u2019t diversify between asset classes, it does help mitigate individual business risk and unsystematic risk.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Proven Performance</h2>\n<p>Finally, index funds have proven performance. Over the long haul, active portfolio managers\u2014including yours truly\u2014cannot beat these funds after accounting for fees. In fact, historically, only about <strong>10</strong> actively managed funds consistently outperform, and <strong>7</strong> of those require investments that you couldn\u2019t afford, while <strong>3</strong> are currently in jail for running Ponzi schemes.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
