If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Max Out Roth 401ks</h2>\n<p>We would start by maxing out our <strong>Roth 401ks</strong>, contributing <strong>$23,500</strong> in 2025.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Lowest Cost Fund Investment</h2>\n<p>Next, we would invest those funds in the lowest cost fund we could find that tracks the <strong>S&P 500</strong> or the <strong>total stock market</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Achieving Financial Freedom</h2>\n<p>We would be tax-free millionaires in just over <strong>12 years</strong>, while still getting to live off of about <strong>$80,000</strong> a year. That's it. That's all I would do. And yes, it can be that simple.</p>",
