Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>The Daily Latte Dilemma</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li>Number one, you could spend <strong>$7</strong> of your paycheck each day for the rest of your life to buy one grande latte.</li>\n  <li>Number two, or you could do what a lot of personal finance gurus tell you to do, save that seven bucks. And if you listen to them and put it in a traditional savings account, next year when you're looking to buy that latte, you're gonna be disappointed because thanks to a <strong>3% annual inflation</strong>, well, now you can only afford the tall latte.</li>\n  <li>Number three, or you could invest that <strong>$7</strong> a day in a low-cost index fund for the next <strong>10 years</strong>, have it appreciate to around <strong>$40,000</strong> and then use the annual <strong>7% interest</strong> to buy yourself a whatever size latte you want each and every day for the rest of your life for free.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>The Takeaway</h2>\n<p>And that is what the wealthy actually mean when they tell you to have your assets buy you stuff.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
