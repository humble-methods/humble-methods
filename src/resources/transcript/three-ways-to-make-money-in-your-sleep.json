  "content": "<h1>3 Legitimate Ways to Make Money in Your Sleep</h1>\n<p>What if I told you that I could show you three legitimate ways to make money in your sleep by the end of today? And all I'm asking is for <strong>45 seconds</strong> of your time. If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Automate Your Retirement Contributions</h2>\n<p>I want you to go to <strong>Human Resources</strong> today and ask them to put <strong>10%</strong> of your paycheck directly into a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> or a <strong>401(k)</strong>. Yeah, this is gonna sting in the short run, but it will be the single most important thing you can ever do for your ultimate financial freedom.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in Index Funds</h2>\n<p>Now, you're going to invest that money into a <strong>low-cost index fund</strong>, or even better, a <strong>no-cost index fund</strong> like Fidelity's <strong>FZROX</strong>. This fund tracks <strong>2,500</strong> of the world's biggest companies. So as they grow, so does your money.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Automate Everything</h2>\n<p>You are going to automate steps one and two so that you never forget to do this on a monthly basis. I want you to forget that you\u2019re even doing this, so that one day, years from now, you\u2019ll look up and say, <strong>Bam!</strong> It\u2019s time to retire.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you, Tyler. Best I got.</p>",
