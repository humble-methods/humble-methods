  "content": "<h1>How to Live Off $2,000,000 in Retirement: A Bold Strategy</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how I would live off of <strong>$2,000,000</strong> in retirement, and I warn you now, this goes against everything you\u2019ve ever been taught. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help you make informed decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest 100% in Stocks</h2>\n<p>First, I would make sure I was invested in <strong>100% stocks</strong> through one or two <strong>low-cost index funds</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Ditch the 4% Rule</h2>\n<p>Next, I'd wave goodbye to the <strong>4% rule</strong>. The average <strong>$2,000,000</strong> portfolio invested 100% in stocks ends up being worth about <strong>$10,000,000</strong> after 30 years with a <strong>4%</strong> annual drawdown.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Start with a 6% Drawdown</h2>\n<p>To keep it conservative, I\u2019d start at <strong>$62,000</strong> with a <strong>6%</strong> drawdown. Adding Social Security, subtracting taxes, carrying the 6, adding the 5, I\u2019d net about <strong>$125,000</strong> a year. Planning to have this vest fully paid off by then, that amount should suffice.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Increase the Drawdown as Needed</h2>\n<p>Even with a <strong>6%</strong> drawdown, I\u2019d still be projected to have a portfolio worth <strong>$2.5 to $2.7 million</strong> after 10 years. So if <strong>6%</strong> won't cut it, let\u2019s kick it into gear and make it <strong>7%</strong>. That way, we\u2019d net closer to <strong>$175,000</strong> a year. Even with that <strong>7%</strong> draw, I\u2019d be projected to return to my original <strong>$2,000,000</strong> portfolio by age <strong>77</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing I only have about <strong>8 to 10 years</strong> left to enjoy life, I\u2019d fittingly start drawing down <strong>8 to 10%</strong> of my assets to net around <strong>$190,000</strong>, confident that by then I\u2019ll be fully engaged in a high-stakes bingo circuit in my retirement community.</p>\n\n<p>I'll go out in style at <strong>85</strong> with nothing left but some uncompleted scorecards and financial content that might help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
