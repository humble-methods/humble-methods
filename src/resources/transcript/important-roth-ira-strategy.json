We were never taught this in school, and that’s why I’m here. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest Your Contributions</h2>\n<p>Once you put money in a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>, you have to invest it. The money sitting in the account is just that—money. It doesn't grow on its own; it just sits there. In fact, it even shrinks due to inflation.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Potential Gains from Cash</h2>\n<p>If you were to max out your Roth IRA every year for <strong>40 years</strong> without investing, you’d have about <strong>$280,000</strong> left sitting in cash.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Investing for Growth</h2>\n<p>However, if you invested that <strong>$7,000</strong> a year in low-cost ETFs like <strong>Vanguard's VOO</strong>, you could end up with closer to <strong>$3.4 million</strong>. That's a staggering <strong>$3.12 million difference</strong>, all for clicking the button to buy <strong>VOO</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
