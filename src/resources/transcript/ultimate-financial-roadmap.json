  "content": "<h1>The Only Financial Roadmap You Will Ever Need: 10 Steps to Financial Success</h1>\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Put Your Own Oxygen Mask On First</h2>\n<p>Your kids can borrow for college; you can’t borrow for retirement. It’s not selfish, it’s math.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Grab Your 401k Match</h2>\n<p>Free money, literally a 50% to 100% return. So if your employer matches 6%, contribute 6%. But then stop there.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Obliterate Your Credit Card Debt</h2>\n<p>Pay down the highest interest rate first. You can’t out-invest 22% interest, other than the 401k employer match.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Get Insured Immediately</h2>\n<p>If anyone depends on your income, secure term life and disability insurance. This is way more crucial than putting three to six months of cash in an emergency fund.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Max Out Your Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Contribute $7,500 in 2026 for tax-free growth forever. You can take back your contributions tax and penalty-free any time.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Max Out Your Health Savings Account (HSA)</h2>\n<p>If eligible, do this for the triple tax advantage. After age 65, it functions like a pre-tax 401k anyway.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Max Out Your 401k</h2>\n<p>Put in $24,500 a year in 2026, and the wheels are starting to turn.</p>\n\n<h2>8. Rethink Your Emergency Fund</h2>\n<p>Keep one to two months of expenses liquid and invest the rest, as holding cash is very expensive.</p>\n\n<h2>9. Open a Taxable Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Invest whatever you can beyond that. This is your flexibility fund. No limits, no penalties.</p>\n\n<h2>10. Handle Other Debt by Interest Rate</h2>\n<p>If it’s over 5%, pay it down immediately. If under 5%, let it ride and invest the money in a low-cost index fund instead.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
