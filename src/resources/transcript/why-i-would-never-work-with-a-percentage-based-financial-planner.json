  "content": "<h1>Three Reasons to Avoid Percentage-Based Financial Planners</h1>\n<p>Hi, I’m Tyler, a former financial adviser and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content with companies like Facet to show you what the future of financial planning looks like.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Disproportionate Prioritization</h2>\n<p>If you have more money to invest, the adviser makes more money. For instance, if Person A has $10 million invested and Person B only has $100,000 invested, who do you think that adviser is prioritizing on a daily basis?</p>\n\n<h2>2. Access Issues for Smaller Investors</h2>\n<p>That’s if they even let you through the door in the first place. If you have $100,000, the odds are you aren’t even worth their time. This is why many people continue to believe that investing is only for the wealthy.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Inequality in Service Delivery</h2>\n<p>And even if you did have $10 million to invest and they let you through the door, how on earth is it 100 times more work to invest $10 million for Person A than it is to invest $100,000 for Person B? I was taught that the perfect portfolio is based on you, regardless of how much money you have to invest.</p>\n\n<p>So if you want to avoid being frustrated by the fee structure of the past, go to <a href='https://facet.com/tyler' target='_blank'>facet.com/tyler</a> today and connect with their team. They will provide you with exceptional service for one flat annual fee.</p>",
