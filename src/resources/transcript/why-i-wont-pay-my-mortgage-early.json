  "content": "<h1>The Top Reason I Refuse to Pay Off My Mortgage Early</h1>\n<p>Here is the number one reason that I will not even put one dime towards paying down my mortgage early.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<p>Recently, I had lunch with my mortgage officer, seeking inspiration for content. I asked her if she thought it was a good financial decision for people to pay off their mortgages early right now. She laughed.</p>\n<p>I asked, \u201cSo is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>She replied, \u201cTyler, for us, the bank, it's a great idea. We would love to get that money back and get all of those low-interest rate loans off of our books.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now, I don't know much, but I do know this: When a bank lender tells you they want their money back, you don\u2019t give it to them. It means there\u2019s a much better opportunity out there.</p>\n<p>I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut Tyler, that mortgage payment is a guaranteed return.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, I was having lunch with a representative of a regional bank. She wouldn\u2019t want the money back unless she knew there was a guaranteed better opportunity. And in a rising interest rate environment, there is.</p>\n<p>Currently, high-yield checking accounts are returning 6%, high-yield savings accounts are returning 5.5%, CDs are returning 5%, and money markets are at 5%. Additionally, investing directly in short-term treasuries can yield similar returns.</p>\n<p>So yes, I could save an additional $80,000 by paying an additional 20% on my mortgage. Or I could earn about double that by investing in short-term and stable securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.</p>\n<p>Yeah, I'll take that bet. If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
