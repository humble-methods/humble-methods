  "content": "<h1>The Best and Worst States to Retire</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Understand Total Cost</h2>\n<p>Before we get to the list, here's my only piece of advice: always look at the total cost, not just the income tax. According to Fidelity, a couple withdrawing <strong>$100,000</strong> a year from their 401(k)s in high-tax Oregon pays a <strong>12.98%</strong> effective tax rate. But in Iowa, it's only <strong>7.66%</strong>. However, Oregon has no sales tax, while Iowa hits you at <strong>7%</strong>. And remember, Florida's no income tax sounds great until your homeowner's insurance triples because of hurricanes. </p>\n\n<h2>2. The Worst States for Retirement</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Hawaii</li>\n  <li>Washington D.C.</li>\n  <li>Minnesota</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Interestingly, California and New York aren’t in the top five worst states. So if you're considering a panic retirement to a state based on its reputation rather than data, remember that Minnesota is quietly taxing your 401(k) at <strong>9.85%</strong>—and nobody's noticing because they've got great hockey and stellar cheese curds.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Best States for Retirement</h2>\n<p>There are <strong>13 states</strong> that do not tax your 401(k) withdrawals at all. In retirement, that's huge:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Alaska</li>\n  <li>Florida</li>\n  <li>Illinois</li>\n  <li>Iowa</li>\n  <li>Mississippi</li>\n  <li>Nevada</li>\n  <li>New Hampshire</li>\n  <li>Pennsylvania</li>\n  <li>South Dakota</li>\n  <li>Tennessee</li>\n  <li>Texas</li>\n  <li>Washington</li>\n  <li>Wyoming</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Iowa and Illinois are the hidden gems—no retirement income tax and lower total costs than Florida once you factor in insurance and property taxes.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
