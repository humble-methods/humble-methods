  "content": "<h1>The Smartest Car Strategy for Retirees</h1>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link on my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Keep Your Car Longer</h2>\n<p>Cars now last over <strong>200,000 miles</strong> with decent maintenance, which could save you tens of thousands of bucks right there.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Don't Dismiss Leasing</h2>\n<p>Though leasing is usually not the best deal, if you drive fewer than <strong>10,000 miles a year</strong> and the interest rates are right, leasing could be great. It allows you to avoid sinking a large amount of upfront money into a depreciating asset.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Best Cars for Retirees</h2>\n<p>The best cars for retirees include the <strong>Toyota Camry</strong>, <strong>Honda CRV</strong>, and <strong>Subaru Outback</strong>. They offer cheap repairs, great mileage, and high resale value. On the flip side, be cautious of high-end brands like <strong>BMW</strong>, <strong>Mercedes</strong>, and <strong>Jaguar</strong>. They come with high depreciation, expensive repairs, and endless unnecessary headaches.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>You know what's cooler than driving around in a Jag? Getting front row parking in Killington, Vermont, because you drive an <strong>Outback</strong>. Seriously, that's a thing.
