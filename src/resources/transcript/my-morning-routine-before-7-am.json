  "content": "<h1>My Morning Routine: 6 Things I Do Before 7 A.M.</h1>\n<p>Here are the six things I do every single morning before <strong>7 a.m.</strong>. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help you optimize your life.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Early Wake-Up</h2>\n<p>I wake up at <strong>4:45 a.m.</strong> to feed my bloodhounds. If it's <strong>4:46 a.m.</strong>, I get a <strong>25-pound claw</strong> to the face to let me know I'm slipping on my daily chores.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Morning Swim</h2>\n<p>At <strong>5 a.m.</strong>, I head down to the local pool to swim a mile. I use flippers because, as my former instructor used to tell me, I'm what's known as a <strong>sinker</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Peloton Mobility Class</h2>\n<p>By <strong>6 a.m.</strong>, I'm back home, logging onto Peloton to take a <strong>20-minute mobility class</strong>. It\u2019s not so much stretching as it is stretching for old people.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Arm Workout</h2>\n<p>At <strong>6:20 a.m.</strong>, I do <strong>10 minutes</strong> of arms and lightweights via the Peloton app because lightweights are about all I can lift without hurting my back.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Meditation Time</h2>\n<p>At <strong>6:30 a.m.</strong>, I spend <strong>10 minutes</strong> meditating in a vain attempt to understand what meditation is actually supposed to do, other than put me back to sleep.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Breakfast</h2>\n<p>Finally, at <strong>6:40 a.m.</strong>, I make myself what has become a <strong>darn good breakfast</strong>: marble rye toast spread with avocado and cottage cheese, covered with two crispy fried eggs, and some hot Vermont salsa.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Morning Walk</h2>\n<p>Lastly, at <strong>6:50 a.m.</strong>, I harness up the bloodhounds for a morning walk, heading out to watch the sun come up over some mountains while doing my best to avoid every other dog in the neighborhood. Otherwise, I\u2019d be holding back <strong>200 pounds</strong> of hound!</p>\n<p>We all know my arms and lightweight routine did not prepare me for that.</p>",
