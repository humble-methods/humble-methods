  "content": "<h1>Here's Why I'm Taking My Social Security Benefits at 62</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler. I'm a former Financial Advisor and Portfolio Manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Health Projections</h2>\n<p>I woke up this morning and looked up when I was gonna die. Yeah, it was one of those days. Based on my age and health patterns, I'm projected to live until 85.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Social Security Projections</h2>\n<p>Next, I went to <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov\">SSA.gov</a> and checked out my most recent projections. I saw that if I retire at 62, I'd get $2,077 a month. If I wait until Full Retirement Age (FRA), I get $2,996 a month.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Avoiding Classic Blunders</h2>\n<p>Then I reminded myself not to fall victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous being: never get involved in a land war in Asia. But only slightly less well-known is, never believe that $1 tomorrow is more valuable than $1 today.</p>\n\n<h2>4. The Power of Compound Growth</h2>\n<p>By investing those funds immediately, there is no point at which taking the money later will ever beat the five to six years of compound growth that I've just gained.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Breaking Even</h2>\n<p>Even if I don't invest those funds and live off them, I still wouldn't break even until I was 77 to 81 years old. So I'll err on the side of caution and break open my 45-year-old piggy bank and never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, <a href=\"[Insert Newsletter Link]\">sign up for my free newsletter</a> in my bio, and every Sunday, I'll send you some more thoughts to help get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
