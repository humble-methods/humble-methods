And it's not because I don't understand math; it's because I do.</p>\n\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. My Current Benefits</h2>\n<p>I woke up this morning and went to <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov\" target=\"_blank\">ssa.gov</a> to check my numbers. I don't know how you spend your mornings, but that's how I spend mine. If I take it at 62, I'll get <strong>$2,479</strong> a month. If I wait until 70, I'll get <strong>$4,636</strong> a month. Sounds like a no-brainer to wait, except it's not. And here's why.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Breakeven Point</h2>\n<p>Because I sat down and took two minutes with a calculator and found my breakeven point—the age at which waiting actually pays more overall money than not waiting. For me, that's <strong>79 years old</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Life Expectancy</h2>\n<p> So I took the next logical step that any level-headed rational thinker would take. I went to an actuarial site and looked up when I was projected to die. And guess what it said? <strong>79 years old</strong>. So if I wait to take it until 70, I'll finally win the Social Security game right around the time my bloodhounds inherit it. But if I take it at 62, I'll get 18 extra years of higher income, better mobility, and maybe just enough more energy to actually enjoy using it.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
