  "content": "<h1>Investment Strategies for Retirement in Your 50s or 60s</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how I would invest $2 million if I were in my 50s or 60s. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Determine Annual Living Expenses</h2>\n<p>First, I would start by working backwards and figure out exactly what I wanted to live on each year. We can usually be safe by taking about <strong>4%</strong> for annual spending without ever having to eat away at the principal. I should be okay so long as I'm comfortable living off <strong>$80,000</strong> a year, complemented by the national average of <strong>$33,000</strong> from Social Security.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Allocate Investments Wisely</h2>\n<p>Next, I would invest <strong>$1 million</strong> in a low-cost growth fund like Invesco's QQQ. Additionally, I would invest <strong>$750,000</strong> into a low-cost dividend fund like Fidelity's FDVV. Finally, I would allocate the remaining <strong>$250,000</strong> into a couple of real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Crown Castle, Boston Properties, or Prologis.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Minimize Fees and Maximize Growth</h2>\n<p>By investing this way, I would be paying virtually nothing in fees. I would take advantage of about <strong>7% to 10%</strong> growth for QQQ, <strong>3% to 4%</strong> annual dividend yields from Fidelity's FDVV, and about <strong>5% to 6%</strong> annual distribution from my REITs. This strategy would leave me with over <strong>$100,000</strong> a year to live on without ever having to touch the principal.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
