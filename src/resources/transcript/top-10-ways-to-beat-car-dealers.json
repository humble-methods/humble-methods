  "content": "<h1>Top 10 Ways to Beat Car Dealers at Their Own Game</h1>\n<p>If you find this useful, like and follow for part two!</p>\n\n<h2>10. Time Your Buying</h2>\n<p>Always time your buying. The dealer wants to sell you this car during slow times\u2014end of the month, end of the day, crummy weather, or beautiful weather.</p>\n\n<h2>9. Get a Car That's In Stock</h2>\n<p>Look for a car that's already in stock and on the lot. Dealers usually get most cars on credit, so they\u2019re paying interest until those cars are sold. They have a much bigger financial incentive to move that inventory first. <strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Tell them you want one that's on the lot but in a slightly different color. If you settle for the one on the lot, negotiate for a price reduction.</p>\n\n<h2>8. Communicate via Email</h2>\n<p>And I cannot stress this one enough: never actually go to a dealership. Email, email, email. Send your exact offer, timeline, and contact information. Let them know you are already in talks with two other competitors and that you look forward to having them earn your business. If they try to get you to come into the store\u2014and they will\u2014politely decline and remind them that you have your offer.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Do Your Market Research</h2>\n<p>Always do your market research first so you\u2019re an informed consumer. If you\u2019re buying a new car, visit <strong>trucar.com</strong> to find the average market value. If you\u2019re buying a used car, go to <strong>kellybluebook.com</strong> for the average market value. Start your negotiations <strong>10%</strong> less than whatever you find.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Be Ready to Walk Away</h2>\n<p>And I cannot stress this one enough: be ready to walk away. Just like you should never go grocery shopping while you\u2019re starving, don\u2019t let the dealership know you need that car today. Show them you\u2019re ready to leave, and you\u2019ll maintain the power. If they sense urgency, that power stays with them.</p>\n\n<p>Want to know the top five tricks for beating car dealers at their own game? Like and follow for part two!</p>",
