  "content": "<h1>The Misery of Doing Our Own Taxes: Why You Should Consider Facet</h1>\n<p>Nothing unites this country quite like the misery of doing our own taxes. It’s the <strong>Super Bowl of stress</strong>, except we all lose, and it looks the same in every house: half-empty coffee mug, <strong>47 browser tabs</strong> open, debating whether your dog’s Instagram page qualifies as a small business.</p>\n\n<h2>The Average Tax Struggle</h2>\n<p>On average, you’re spending <strong>13 hours</strong> a year voluntarily submitting to this torture, arguing with some random tax app about whether a stapler counts as a business expense.</p>\n\n<h2>Facet: A Better Solution</h2>\n<p>With <strong>Facet</strong>, taxes are no longer a once-a-year scramble. They’re baked into your financial plan year-round. Whether it’s a Roth conversion or stock sale, these actions are planned out and accounted for before they turn into an expensive April surprise.</p>\n\n<h2>No More Guesswork</h2>\n<p>Instead of hoping you magically clicked all the right buttons on your own, you can either <strong>DIY file online</strong> with a pro reviewing your work, or let a certified tax professional take it all off your plate, depending on which plan works for you.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Go to <strong>facet.com/tyler</strong> today, and let their partnered tax team do the heavy lifting for you.</p>",
