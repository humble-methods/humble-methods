For the past <strong>10 years</strong>, I\u2019ve donated about <strong>$100,000</strong> a year to <strong>Harvard</strong>.</p>\n<p>Because Harvard is a <strong>501(c)(3)</strong> non-profit, I am allowed to deduct the entire <strong>$100,000</strong> donation.</p>\n<p>Wow! We're just getting started.</p>\n<p>When you apply to Harvard next year, because I went there and your sister is there now, you will be considered a <strong>legacy applicant</strong> and a <strong>donor applicant</strong>. Your application might conveniently find its way to the top of the stack.</p>\n<p>Oh, Crimson, what dorm do you think I\u2019d be in?</p>\n<p>Probably the one that's named after our family.</p>\n<p>Where did you learn about this?</p>\n<p>I just follow <strong>Social Cat</strong>. It makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
