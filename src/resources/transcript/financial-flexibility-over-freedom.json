  "content": "<h1>Why Financial Flexibility is More Important Than Financial Freedom</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Vagueness of Freedom</h2>\n<p>Freedom sounds great until you realize it's way too vague to be useful. Everyone wants freedom, but no one can define it. Flexibility, however, is easy to understand—I can skip this meeting without asking permission.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Portability of Flexibility</h2>\n<p>Flexibility is portable, whereas freedom is often just performative. You don’t need to sell your house and move to Bali to feel rich; you need a calendar that doesn't make you want to fake your own disappearance.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Compounding Nature of Flexibility</h2>\n<p>Flexibility compounds. A bit more control over your time today leads to even more control tomorrow. It’s like <strong>compound interest</strong>, but for sanity.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So, stop idolizing freedom and start designing for flexibility because that’s the version of wealth you can actually feel every single day.</p>",
