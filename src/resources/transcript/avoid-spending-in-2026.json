  "content": "<h1>5 Things I Refuse to Spend Money On in 2026</h1>\n<p>Most financial advisors are gonna hate this. Here’s what I, Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, will be avoiding this year.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Whole Life Insurance</h2>\n<p>This is marketed as an investment and insurance combination. But the reality is that it generates a 6% commission for your advisor and offers a meager 2% return for you. Not worth it.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Variable Annuities</h2>\n<p>Congratulations, your advisor gets a 6% to 7% commission to lock you into an annuity, complete with surrender charges and crippling fees. Leave this behind.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Front-Loaded Mutual Funds</h2>\n<p>You invest $10,000, and your advisor pockets $575 right off the bat as a commission. That means you start with just $9,425. It doesn’t make sense to give that much away.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Buffered ETFs</h2>\n<p>These funds tout having a downside protection floor, yet you end up paying 0.7% to 1% in fees just to hold them. The costs aren't justified by their benefits.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Paying an Advisor 1% of My Assets</h2>\n<p>No matter their performance, whether they beat the market or not, I refuse to pay an advisor 1% of my assets. Instead, I recommend checking out <a href='https://facet.com/tyler'>facet.com/tyler</a> today. Their CFP professionals have your best interest at heart, offering financial planning without commissions or percentage-based fees.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, it’s important to spend wisely. Avoid these five pitfalls for a more robust financial future.</p>",
