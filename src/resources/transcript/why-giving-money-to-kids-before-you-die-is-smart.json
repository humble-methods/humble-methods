  "content": "<h1>Why You Should Consider Giving Money to Your Kids Before You Die</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Early Gifts Grow More</h2>\n<p>A <strong>$10,000</strong> gift at age <strong>30</strong> could turn into <strong>$100,000</strong> by age <strong>60</strong>. In contrast, that same gift at <strong>60</strong> might be spent on dental work.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Small Amounts Train Behavior</h2>\n<p>Giving small, structured gifts helps your kids learn how to handle money responsibly without wrecking their financial car at 100 miles per hour.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Your Kids Need Help More Than Millions</h2>\n<p>Your kids don’t need millions when they’re retired; they need your help! Daycare can cost more than their mortgage, and they are trying to save for a college experience that costs more than buying the daycare business outright. By helping them now, you can control your giving in a way that benefits both of you—a win-win situation.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Consider these factors before deciding how and when to assist your children financially.</p>",
