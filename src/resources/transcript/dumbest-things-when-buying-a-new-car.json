  "content": "<h1>The Three Dumbest Mistakes to Avoid When Buying a New Car</h1>\n<p>Here are the three dumbest things you could do when buying a new car. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Going to the Dealership</h2>\n<p>The dealership will do everything they can to wear you down and make you wait for hours until you're so sick of life that you'll buy that car for whatever price they say.</p>\n<h2>2. Spending Time Negotiating a Monthly Payment</h2>\n<p>The reason the finance person makes more money than anyone else at a car dealership is they can present you with any monthly payment you want. However, they will make up for it tenfold by adjusting down payment, unnecessary fees, residual payments, or length of the lease or term payments. Always talk MSRP only whether buying or leasing.</p>\n<h2>3. Saying Yes to Anything the Finance Department Offers After the Deal</h2>\n<p>This is where the dealership makes higher profit margins than in any other area. Additional insurance and final add-ons are absurdly overpriced, and you can get all of those options through your own bank if you need to.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please <strong>like</strong> and <strong>follow</strong> my content, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
