I can claim the full <strong>20% pass-through deduction</strong> as long as my wife and I make under <strong>$340,000</strong> of income.</p> <p><strong>That saves you $9,520.</strong> Drops me down to the <strong>32% tax bracket.</strong></p> <p>You've done your homework.</p> <p>Oh, I just follow Social Cap. Makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
