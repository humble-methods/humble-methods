  "content": "<h1>The Essential Investing Guide: How to Become a Millionaire by Age 65</h1>\n<p>Hi, I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. My goal is to provide free financial content so you can achieve financial freedom without the costs.</p>\n\n<h2>Investing at 20</h2>\n<p>If you're <strong>20 years old</strong>, you only need to invest <strong>$319</strong> a month, which breaks down to just <strong>$10.50</strong> a day. This is a small price to pay for future financial freedom.</p>\n\n<h2>Investing at 30</h2>\n<p>However, if you wait until you're <strong>30</strong>, you\u2019ll need to invest about <strong>$606</strong> a month, or <strong>$20</strong> a day. It\u2019s getting more expensive to become a millionaire!</p>\n\n<h2>Investing at 40</h2>\n<p>If you reach <strong>40</strong> without investing, you're looking at needing to save approximately <strong>$1,300</strong> a month. Is it doable? Yes. Is it an uphill battle? Definitely.</p>\n\n<h2>Start Now</h2>\n<p>As the saying goes, <em>the best time to plant a tree was 30 years ago; the second best time is today</em>. Open a brokerage account, fund it with just <strong>$50</strong> a month, and invest in <strong>low-cost index funds</strong>. Your future self will thank you for it.</p>\n\n<footer>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please <strong>like</strong> and <strong>follow</strong> for more tips, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to your financial goals!</p>\n</footer>",
