  "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Here's exactly how I would live off of $2 million in retirement without ever running out of money. I'm Tyler, former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p><h2>Investment Strategy</h2><p><strong>Number one:</strong> First, I'd make sure I was 100% invested in stocks. I'll tell you why in a minute.</p><h2>Withdrawal Strategy</h2><p><strong>Number two:</strong> Next, I'd draw down about 6% annually, netting about $100,000 a year post-tax.</p><h2>Social Security</h2><p><strong>Number three:</strong> Then I'd take my social security at 62, bringing in another $20,000 a year post-tax.</p><h2>Understanding Risks</h2><p><strong>Number four:</strong> Next, I would remind you that I am not out of my mind. As legendary investor Peter Lynch, one of the only investors in history who could and did beat the market on an annual basis, he ran the numbers himself and showed that by staying 100% in stocks, you could withdraw up to 7% per year and still have a 96% chance of not running out of money.</p><p>And as I'd be drawing only 6%, my portfolio would most likely continue to grow as my time on this earth would continue to shrink.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>And if any of this is helpful, like and follow and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
