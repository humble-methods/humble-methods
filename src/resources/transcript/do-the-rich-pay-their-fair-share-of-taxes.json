An Insightful Conversation</h1>\n<p>Hey dad, is it true the rich don't pay their fair share of taxes?</p>\n<p><strong>Absolutely!</strong> This year I made almost a million dollars and didn't pay a dime of taxes on it.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding the Tax Breakdowns</h2>\n<p>500,000 was profits from selling our home, 200,000 was unrealized capital gains in the stock market, and 100,000 was realized capital gains in the stock market. However, I offset those with losses elsewhere.</p>\n\n<h2>Investments and Contributions</h2>\n<p>Out of that amount, 100,000 of it I just put back into more real estate investment properties, 61,000 went directly into my SEP IRA, and 39,000 went into our private family foundation.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>So instead of almost 37%, you paid... about <strong>1%</strong>.</p>",
