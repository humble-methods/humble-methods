I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>The Illusion of Beating the Market</h2>\n<p>The number one reason you do not want to beat the S&P 500 is that many new investors believe they are outperforming the market each day.</p>\n\n<h2>The Role of Tech Stocks</h2>\n<p>What many of these investors don't realize is that they've often beaten the S&P 500 on a given day because a higher percentage of their portfolio is weighted in <strong>tech stocks</strong>, which are highly volatile. This can lead to big ups and big downs.</p>\n\n<h2>A Portfolio Comparison</h2>\n<p>Consider two portfolios:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Portfolio A gains <strong>20%</strong> this year and <strong>0%</strong> next year.</li>\n  <li>Portfolio B gains <strong>10%</strong> this year and <strong>10%</strong> next year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although both portfolios average <strong>10%</strong> returns, after two years, Portfolio A has made <strong>20%</strong>, while Portfolio B has made <strong>21%</strong> because of compound interest and lower volatility.</p>\n\n<h2>Building the Ideal Portfolio</h2>\n<p>When creating the ideal portfolio for long-term wealth building, remember to diversify across various factors:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Sectors:</strong> Tech, healthcare, utility</li>\n  <li><strong>Market Cap:</strong> Large, small, micro</li>\n  <li><strong>Geographical Region</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Asset Class:</strong> Stocks, bonds, real estate alternatives</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please <strong>like and follow</strong>, and I'll keep trying to guide you one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
