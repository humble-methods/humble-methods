  "content": "<h1>Three Retirement Stats That Should Terrify You</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, and here are three important retirement statistics that should send shivers down your spine:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Median Retirement Savings</h2>\n<p>The median retirement savings for an American household is about <strong>$88,000</strong>. This means that half of all Americans have less than that. If you retire at 65 and live to 85, that's roughly <strong>$4,500</strong> a year. You literally cannot survive on that. This raises the question: is the system broken, or have we been teaching retirement planning completely wrong?</p>\n\n<h2>2. Retirement Dependency on Social Security</h2>\n<p>Approximately <strong>64%</strong> of Americans will retire broke, dependent entirely on Social Security checks that average about <strong>$1,900</strong> a month. Yet many of these individuals continue to pay 1% of what they have to financial advisors, who clearly aren't resolving the issue.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Fear of Running Out of Money</h2>\n<p>Nearly <strong>two out of three Americans</strong> are more worried about running out of money than they are about dying. This is because they lack a plan for spending their money responsibly in retirement. Without a solid strategy in place, the anxiety can be overwhelming.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid ending up in this situation, go to <a href=\"facet.com/tyler\">facet.com/tyler</a> to talk to a team of CFP professionals who can help you map out your retirement, providing you with a plan to get from A to B, all for one flat annual membership fee. If the current system isn't working, it's probably time to try something else.</p>",
