  "content": "<h1>Investing Your First $10,000</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it. If I had to start over with $10,000 today, here's exactly how I'd invest it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. S&P 500 Fund</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>$4,000</strong> into an S&P 500 fund, either <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/fidelity-500-index-fund/overview\">Fidelity's FXAIX</a> or <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/voo\">Vanguard's VOO</a>. These funds are as cheap and tax-efficient as you'll find, and they hold 500 of the world's biggest, most profitable companies, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Growth or Tech Fund</h2>\n<p>Next, I'd allocate <strong>$3,000</strong> into a growth or tech-heavy fund like <a href=\"https://www.invesco.com/us/etfs/product-detail?name=QQQM\">QQQM</a> or <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VGT\">VGT</a>. These funds are still cheap and tilted towards tech companies that I believe will dominate the next decade. While this option is riskier than the S&P 500, being young provides the time to weather the volatility and appreciate the long-term projected rewards.</p>\n\n<h2>3. International Stock ETF</h2>\n<p>For <strong>$2,000</strong>, I'd invest in an international stock ETF like <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VXUS\">Vanguard's VXUS</a>. While the U.S. market is great, history shows that no one country's economy will win forever. Japan dominated the 80s, the U.S. thrived in the 2010s — but we never know what the 2030s will bring. Therefore, diversifying globally is crucial.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Money Market Fund</h2>\n<p>Finally, I'd place <strong>$1,000</strong> in a money market fund like <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/money-market/fidelity-government-money-market-fund/fpxx\">Fidelity's SPAXX</a>. This fund is currently earning around 4% and invests in safe, short-term government securities like T-bills, providing immediate liquidity and peace of mind.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
