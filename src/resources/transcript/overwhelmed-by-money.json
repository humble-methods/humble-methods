If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Financial Tool Overload</h2>\n<p>There are <strong>8,000 financial tools</strong>, <strong>11 types of IRAs</strong>, and approximately <strong>three TikTok bros</strong> yelling at you to buy real estate that you can't afford. Of course, you're confused!</p>\n\n<h2>2. It's About Bandwidth, Not IQ</h2>\n<p>We often act like being good with money is all about <strong>IQ</strong>, but it’s really about <strong>bandwidth</strong>. If you're burned out, even a basic weekly budget feels like another unpaid job.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Focus on Five Key Habits</h2>\n<p>Most of what you need comes down to <strong>five habits</strong>. The rest is just less noise with better marketing. So you're not broken; the system is just too loud.</p>",
