  "content": "<h1>Smart Financial Strategies for Women in Their 30s and 40s Receiving Inheritance</h1>\n<p>If you're a woman in your 30s or 40s and you're banking on that $100,000 inheritance from grandma to make you a millionaire, you need to do the following three things right now.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Secure Your Inheritance</h2>\n<p>When you receive that money, <strong>put it into a secured account immediately</strong>. This can be a high-yield savings account, a brokerage account in which you invest in money market funds, or even just a personal savings account. This will allow you to keep the money while you take a breath.</p>\n<p><strong>Do not make any major investing decisions in the first three to six months</strong> of getting this money. Consult with an advisor, consult with your family, and allow your emotions to cool before you decide on the appropriate plan of action.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Avoid Unaffordable Purchases</h2>\n<p><strong>Do not use this money to put a down payment on something that you cannot afford</strong>. That will just dig you deeper into debt. Instead, if you really want a 20% guaranteed return immediately, consider paying down your credit card debt. I know, it's not sexy, but it's a lot sexier than living beyond your means and accumulating more debt.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Allow Yourself Some Freedom</h2>\n<p>Finally, <strong>do allow yourself to spend 15 to 20% of that inheritance on anything you want</strong>. Why? Because you are going to be tempted to do it anyway. You might as well put a hard cap on what you're allowed to spend now, and invest the rest into a long-term core strategy.</p>\n<p>This approach will set you up for long-term generational wealth, allowing you to leave that same gift to your kids.</p>",
