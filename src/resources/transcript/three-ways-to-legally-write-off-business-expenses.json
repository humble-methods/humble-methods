  "content": "<h1>Three Ways to Legally Write Off Any Business Expense</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Business Purpose</h2>\n<p>The expense needs to have a business purpose, such as a meal with a business partner, a trip to meet with clients, or purchasing new equipment for your startup. As long as your primary purpose is spending the money on your business, you're in the clear.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Ordinary Expense</h2>\n<p>The expense must be considered ordinary, which means it must be reasonable compared to what others in your industry are doing and spending on a regular basis. This is why some high-ticket real estate agents can write off G-wagons, as it is customary to present wealth to those with wealth. If it's customary and usual, you can write it off.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Necessary Expenses</h2>\n<p>The expense must be necessary. In other words, the purpose of your spending money must be to make more money. This is not a limitation; it\u2019s an invitation from the IRS to invest every penny you have into growing your business and making as much money as possible for you and your clients.</p>\n\n<p>So sit down right now and brainstorm a list of all the ways that you could invest in yourself, your clients, and your business. Guess what? That list can be funded with 100% tax-free money.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, <strong>like</strong> and <strong>follow</strong>, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
