  "content": "<h1>Three Things I Would Never Give My Kid for Christmas</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Gift Cards</h2>\n<p>Single worst financial move you'll ever make. Oh, that's an exaggeration, but you might as well go hand your local Home Depot $3.48. Tell them Merry Christmas because the average unused money for gift cards is up over $187 per person in 2024.</p>\n<h2>2. Appreciated Stock</h2>\n<p>Here, son, here's a stock. And when you sell it, you get to pay taxes. Maybe you could use that unused gift card from number one. Pass down the stock once you die, cost basis reset, zero taxes for your kids. Much better gift.</p>\n<h2>3. Clothes</h2>\n<p>If they need the clothes, don't double dip and pretend it's a Christmas gift. They want video games and they want them now.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
