  "content": "<h2>How I Would Invest My First $500</h2>\n<p>Hello, I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Invest in a Low-Cost Total Stock Market Fund</h3>\n<p>First, I would invest $450 in a low-cost total stock market fund. This fund will give you exposure to all the blue chip companies in the S&P and the NASDAQ but also includes smaller companies that usually have room for further growth. Over the last 80 years, smaller companies have outperformed larger companies by almost 2%.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Allocate Funds to an Emerging Markets Fund</h3>\n<p>Next, I would invest the remaining $50 in an emerging markets fund. This investment allows for direct exposure to fast-growing markets in countries like China, India, and Brazil.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Automate Your Investments</h3>\n<p>Lastly, I would automate transfers of $50 a week into this account. Consistently invest $45 in the total market fund and $5 in the emerging market fund. By following this strategy diligently, in 40 years, you could potentially have over a million dollars waiting for you.</p>\n\n<p>If you find any of this information helpful, please like and follow for more tips. I\u2019m here to help you take that step closer to your financial goals!</p>",
