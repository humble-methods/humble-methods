  "content": "<h1>Why I Don’t Care About a Looming Stock Market Crash</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Here’s exactly why I do not care about a looming stock market crash, and I never will:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Historical Perspective</h2>\n<p>Since 1987, we have experienced two major market crashes, four recessions, two debt ceilings, and roughly 470 headlines claiming it's the end of capitalism. Yet...</p>\n\n<h2>2. Long-term Growth</h2>\n<p>A $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 has grown to over $280,000 over that time period. It goes to show the resilience and growth potential of the market.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Timing the Market</h2>\n<p>On the other hand, those who kept waiting for stability are still waiting. Don’t let CNBC or any financial news outlet dictate your investment strategy. Remember, they are entertainers with access to a Bloomberg terminal, not your personal financial advisors.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this resonates with you, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
