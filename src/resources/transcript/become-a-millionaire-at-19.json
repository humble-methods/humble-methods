  "content": "<h1>How to Become a Millionaire by 27: A Guide for 19-Year-Olds</h1>\n<p>If you're 19 years old and you would like to be a millionaire before all of your friends are, you might want to consider doing the following three things today.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Open a Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Open a brokerage account through <strong>Fidelity</strong>, <strong>Schwab</strong>, or <strong>Vanguard</strong>. Fund that account with <strong>$166 a month</strong> and invest that amount into a <strong>no-cost index fund</strong> like Fidelity's <em>FNILX</em>. You heard me, no fees.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Consistent Investment</h2>\n<p>Continue funding and investing that <strong>$166 a month</strong> for the next <strong>seven years</strong>. Then stop the day you turn <strong>27</strong>. Sit back, relax, and appreciate that without lifting another finger or investing another penny, you will most likely be a millionaire by retirement.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Start Today</h2>\n<p>Do not wait even one more day to do this. If you wait until you're 27 to start investing, even if you put that <strong>$166 a month</strong> into that account now every month until you turn <strong>65</strong>, you would still only end up with about <strong>$800,000</strong>. That is nearly a quarter of a million dollar difference. All because you chose to start investing right now.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, <strong>like and follow</strong>, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
