  "content": "<h1>3 Signs It Might Be Time to Break Up with Your Financial Advisor</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Paying 1% Without Clarity</h2>\n<p>If you're paying <strong>1% a year</strong> and can't really explain what you're getting, it's a red flag. If your advisor's value boils down to a quarterly phone call asking about your kid's soccer game—even though your kids play tennis—then you're likely overpaying.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Discovering Low-Cost Alternatives</h2>\n<p>Because you watch this channel, you've discovered <strong>low-cost index funds</strong> and flat-fee planning. You realize you've been paying someone <strong>1%</strong> for years to do what a target date retirement fund can achieve for about <strong>1/20th</strong> of the price.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Confusion Over Annuities</h2>\n<p>If they sold you an annuity that you don't understand—or worse, an annuity that they don't understand—then it's time for a breakup text with no follow-up. Just ghost that, and do it now. You don't owe them anything; you’ve already paid them enough.</p>",
