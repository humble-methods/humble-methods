  "content": "<h1>Top 3 Reasons Why the Roth 401(k) Outshines the Roth IRA</h1>\n<p>Hi, I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free so that you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Higher Contribution Limits</h2>\n<p>The Roth 401(k) allows for contributions of up to <strong>$23,000 a year</strong>, in contrast to the <strong>$7,000 a year</strong> limit for the Roth IRA. Why is there such a difference? Unfortunately, I have no idea.</p>\n\n<h2>2. No Income Limits</h2>\n<p>Another significant advantage is that there are <strong>no income limits</strong> for contributing to a Roth 401(k). In contrast, the Roth IRA does impose income limits. Again, the reasoning behind this distinction remains unclear.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)</h2>\n<p>While it\u2019s true that both the Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA have required minimum distributions, the potential growth in a Roth 401(k) can be substantially greater. This can lead to considerable wealth that you can pass down to your partner or children, entirely tax-free.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow for more tips. I\u2019ll keep trying to guide you one step closer to your financial goals!</p>",
