Nothing.</p>\n<p>Capital gains are taxed at a lower rate, but they're still taxed.</p>\n<p>Oh, no. I also sold some of my stocks that didn\u2019t do so well and locked in a <strong>long-term capital gains loss</strong> of <strong>$53,000</strong>.</p>\n<p>Is this just some secret of the rich?</p>\n<p>No, we can all do it. It\u2019s called <strong>tax-loss harvesting</strong>. Sell losing stocks and use them to offset my winners.</p>\n<p>Well, why did you lock in an additional <strong>$3,000</strong> loss?</p>\n<p>Because if the losses are greater than the gains, I can use them to offset up to <strong>$3,000</strong> of my regular income.</p>\n<p>Sounds tricky.</p>\n<p>Oh, it is. That\u2019s why I follow <strong>Social Cat</strong>. He makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
