  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $2 Million for Retirement Without Running Out of Money</h1>\n<p>If you're looking to invest <strong>$2 million</strong> for retirement without ever running out of money, here’s how I would approach it. If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, where we'll delve into this in more depth, you know—like more than <strong>62 seconds</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Build a Three-Bucket System</h2>\n<p>Start by building a <strong>three-bucket system</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Cash and T-bills</strong> for short-term liquidity,</li>\n    <li><strong>Dividend stocks and REITs</strong> for cash flow,</li>\n    <li><strong>Growth stocks</strong> for, well, growth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>2. Avoid the Bond Trap</h2>\n<p>Avoid falling into the <strong>bond trap</strong>. Even though you've been told that bonds are <strong>A)</strong> safe and <strong>B)</strong> should be increased in your portfolio as you get older, remember that they likely won’t outpace inflation. If you're earning <strong>3% to 4%</strong> a year on those bonds while withdrawing <strong>5% to 6%</strong> from your portfolio, they won’t keep up with your needs.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Strategic Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>For withdrawals, use whatever percentage rule works for you but adjust for market conditions. For instance, if the market is up <strong>25%</strong> this year, sure, take <strong>8%</strong>. But if the market was down <strong>10%</strong>, you want to take advantage of cash and dividends this year instead to avoid depleting long-term growth. I trust you don’t need an annual rule to tell you this.</p>\n\n<h2>Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>The bottom line is that <strong>$2 million</strong> can last forever, but only if you invest it in growth, keep cash available for flexibility, and withdraw wisely.</p>\n\n<p>If you found this information helpful, please like and follow, and I’ll keep sharing insights to guide you on your financial journey.</p>",
