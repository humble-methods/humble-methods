You owe us. <strong>Nothing.</strong></p> <p>Crypto is taxed just like stocks.</p> <p>Yes, it is. But I also locked in <strong>$100,000</strong> of losses on Bitcoin because it went from <strong>$60,000</strong> to <strong>$20,000</strong> and I owned <strong>2.5 coins.</strong></p> <p>But it says here you still own <strong>2.5 bitcoins.</strong></p> <p>Yep. I sold the coins on Monday to lock in the loss and take the tax advantage and I bought them back on Tuesday so I don't miss out on any potential gains by locking in the losses.</p> <p><strong>That's called a wash sale</strong> and you are not allowed to buy back the identical security.</p> <p>Correct. And guess what? <strong>Bitcoin is not considered a security.</strong> So I owe you nothing. Nothing.</p> <p>But I still have my Bitcoin and my <strong>$100,000 gains tax-free.</strong></p>",
