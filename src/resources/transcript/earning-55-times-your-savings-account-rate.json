Now I create financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Start by opening a <strong>brokerage account</strong> via <strong>Fidelity</strong>, <strong>Schwab</strong>, or <strong>Vanguard</strong>. It’ll take you <strong>five minutes</strong> and it’s free.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Link Your Bank Account</h2>\n<p>Now link your bank account to that brokerage account.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Fund the Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Fund the brokerage account with the money that was previously going into your savings account.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Research Money Market Funds</h2>\n<p>Go to <strong>NerdWallet</strong> or <strong>Bankrate</strong> and look up top low-cost <strong>money market funds</strong>. These funds invest in short-term government securities like <strong>T-bills</strong> and are relatively safe and highly accessible. Currently, these funds are earning around <strong>4.5%</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Invest and Celebrate</h2>\n<p>Now invest the money in those funds, congratulate yourself on your newfound financial literacy, and take yourself out for a grande orange mocha frappuccino because you literally just earned it!</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
