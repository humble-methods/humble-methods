  "content": "<h1>How a Custodial Roth IRA Can Build Wealth for Your Child</h1>\n<p>Tyler?</p>\n<p>Yep.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like your <strong>10-year-old</strong> has an IRA that will be worth a little over <strong>$63,000</strong> by the time they're <strong>18</strong>. Just over <strong>$3.7 million</strong> by the time they\u2019re <strong>60</strong>?</p>\n<p>Yep.</p>\n<p>Aren\u2019t they a little young to be allowed to do this?</p>\n<p>No. This is a <strong>custodial Roth IRA</strong>. There are no age limits as long as they have earned income. They can contribute the lesser of <strong>$6,000</strong> or whatever they earn.</p>\n<p>So you had them doing child labor?</p>\n<p>No. They babysat, mowed the lawn, and did some dog walking.</p>\n\n<h2>Tax Benefits of Contributions</h2>\n<p>Okay, well good thing we taxed those contributions before you put them in at your <strong>35%</strong> income tax.</p>\n<p>Sorry, it\u2019s a custodial Roth IRA. Contributions are taxed at the child's tax rate, which is usually around <strong>10%</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Accessing Contributions and Earnings</h2>\n<p>But remember, they can't touch those contributions until <strong>59 and a half</strong>. With a Roth IRA, you can take back the contributions at any time, <strong>penalty-free</strong> and <strong>tax-free</strong>, but no touching those earnings.</p>\n<p>So you\u2019re really going to be upset. A child can actually take up to <strong>$10,000</strong> of earnings for their first home, as long as the account has been open and funded for <strong>five years</strong>. They can even use some of the earnings on qualified educational expenses.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So what do we get? <strong>10%</strong> of what my child makes now, <strong>0%</strong> of <strong>$3.7 million</strong> later.</p>",
