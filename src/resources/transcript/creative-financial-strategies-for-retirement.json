  "content": "<h1>How Creative Strategies Can Turn $2.5 Million into $10 Million for Retirement</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how <strong>creative Tyler</strong> turns a <strong>$2.5 million</strong> retirement into a <strong>$10 million</strong> retirement. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you on your financial journey.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Journey of Uncreative Tyler</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s say <strong>uncreative Tyler</strong> makes <strong>$250,000</strong> a year in salary and an additional <strong>$250,000</strong> a year in bonuses. He maxes out his <strong>401(k)</strong>, <strong>traditional IRA</strong>, and <strong>HSA</strong>. In doing this, he defers taxes on <strong>6.83%</strong> of his salary. By doing this for <strong>30 years</strong>, he will have <strong>$2.5 million</strong> of pre-tax retirement funds. Not too shabby.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Creative Tyler's Non-Qualified Option</h2>\n<p>But <strong>creative Tyler</strong> thinks a little differently about tax deferral. Bored with the typical qualified tax deferral options, he decides to pursue a non-qualified option. He creates a written agreement with his company to place <strong>$100,000</strong> a year of his bonus into <strong>company stock</strong> until he retires. The company agrees to pay him <strong>5%</strong> annually on this money, and Tyler still maxes out his other qualified accounts.</p>\n<p>As a result, he now defers taxes on <strong>26.83%</strong> of his salary and ultimately retires with over <strong>$10 million</strong> in pre-tax funds.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Living Off Interest</h2>\n<p>By deferring an additional <strong>20%</strong> of his salary, <strong>creative Tyler</strong> now retires with confidence, living off about <strong>$800,000</strong> a year in interest alone.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
