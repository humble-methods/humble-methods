  "content": "<h1>3 Ways to Lower Your Medicare Premiums, Even If You're Wealthy</h1>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Medicare premiums go up when your income does, but there are smart ways to stay under the limits and keep more money in your pocket.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Roth Conversions Before Age 63</h2>\n<p>Why 63? Medicare premiums are based on your income from two years ago. So the year you turn <strong>63</strong> is when IRMA (Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount) starts to matter.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Smooth Out Your Taxable Income</h2>\n<p>If you're above key IRMA limits (<strong>$103,000</strong> for singles, <strong>$206,000</strong> for married filing jointly), you'll pay more for Medicare Parts B and D. Roth conversions allow you to smooth out your annual taxable income.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Withdrawals from Roth Do Not Count Towards MAGI</h2>\n<p>Once converted, withdrawals from your Roth IRA do not count towards your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). So if you need cash and want to stay under the IRMA limits, tap the Roth or other savings accounts instead of drawing from your 401k or other pre-tax accounts. Stay under the radar and smooth out taxable income.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>And someone please tell me in the comments why Lin-Manuel did not agree to do the music for Moana 2. That soundtrack just didn't hit the same.</p>",
