  "content": "<h1>Investing Your Roth IRA at 18: The Case for One Fund</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Choose Vanguard's Growth ETF (VUG)</h2>\n<p>I would invest my Roth IRA exclusively in <strong>VUG</strong>, Vanguard's growth ETF. With an expense ratio of just <strong>0.04%</strong>, it's literally the lowest in the industry for what you get. There's no need to diversify into dividend funds, bonds, or REITs—especially when you've got decades of potential growth ahead of you.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Historical Returns</h2>\n<p>Growth funds like VUG have historically returned <strong>10% to 12%</strong> in real terms (post-inflation). Over a span of 40 plus years, that kind of return compounds into a ridiculous amount of money.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Max Your Contributions</h2>\n<p>If you max out your Roth IRA every year, contributing <strong>$7,500</strong> in 2026 (which is over <strong>$140 a week</strong>), and do that from age 18 to 65, at a 10% annual return, you'll end up with about <strong>$3.4 million</strong>. That's 100% tax-free, post-inflation, all from just one fund and one decisive investment.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
