  "content": "<h1>How to Allocate $1,000,000 for Income at 50 Years Old</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)</h2>\n<p>I would allocate <strong>35%</strong> of the portfolio to <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/voo/overview\">Vanguard's Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)</a>. This fund provides broad exposure to the entire U.S. stock market.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS)</h2>\n<p>Next, I would invest <strong>15%</strong> in <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/vxus/overview\">Vanguard's Total International Stock ETF (VXUS)</a>. This fund allows you to diversify your holdings internationally.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)</h2>\n<p>Then, I'd put <strong>10%</strong> of the funds in <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/vig/overview\">Vanguard's Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)</a> for stable dividend income from high-quality companies.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Vanguard Total Bond Fund (BND)</h2>\n<p>Next, <strong>25%</strong> would go into <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/bnd/profile\">Vanguard's Total Bond Fund (BND)</a>. This fund offers stability and follows a more conservative growth strategy.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF (VGIT)</h2>\n<p>I would allocate <strong>10%</strong> to <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/vgit/overview\">Vanguard's Intermediate-Term Treasury ETF (VGIT)</a> for moderate risk with stable returns.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF (VGSH)</h2>\n<p>Finally, <strong>5%</strong> should go to <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/vgsh/overview\">Vanguard's Short-Term Treasury ETF (VGSH)</a>. This investment is excellent for liquidity and provides a buffer during market downturns.</p>\n\n<p>This allocation reflects a classic <strong>60-40 stock-bond split</strong>. While there's still a need for growth at age 50, it's equally crucial to safeguard against market volatility. This portfolio aims to achieve around <strong>8% nominal returns</strong>, with the dividend-focused fund helping to generate income without the need to sell shares.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, this plan incorporates a <strong>bond ladder</strong>, providing long, intermediate, and short-term treasuries for stability while allowing you to take advantage of the best yield on the curve at any time.
