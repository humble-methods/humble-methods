  "content": "<h1>How to Pay Almost Zero in Taxes in Retirement</h1>\n<p>If I were in my late 50s, here’s how I’d pay almost zero in taxes in retirement.</p>\n\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I create financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Do Roth Conversions</h2>\n<p>If you retire at <strong>60</strong>, you’ve got a <strong>tax sweet spot</strong> before Social Security and RMDs kick in. Convert then and enjoy tax-free withdrawals for life.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Stay in the 0% Capital Gains Tax Bracket</h2>\n<p>Stay in the <strong>0% capital gains tax bracket</strong> as long as you can. If your taxable income is under <strong>$96,700</strong> as a couple, you can sell investments and owe <strong>$0</strong> in federal tax. Smart retirees plan for this on purpose.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Load Up on Tax-Free Income Sources</h2>\n<p>Load up on <strong>tax-free income sources</strong> now, like municipal bonds, Roth IRA assets, and HSAs. The biggest mistake retirees make isn’t how much they earn; it's how much they keep or don’t keep.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Play your tax cards right in your 50s, and you can spend retirement living virtually tax-free. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
