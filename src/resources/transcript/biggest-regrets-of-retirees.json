  "content": "<h1>3 Biggest Regrets of Retirees and How to Avoid Them</h1>\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Money as a Tool, Not a Goal</h2>\n<p>Many retirees realize too late that money is just a tool, not the goal. They saved their whole lives, struggled to spend, and built their identity around hoarding. The happiest retirees create an <strong>emergency spending account</strong> to actually enjoy life. The only catch? Use it or lose it every year.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Worrying About Running Out of Money</h2>\n<p>They worried for decades about running out of money, only to die with more than they started retirement with. All that <strong>4%</strong> fear-mongering for nothing!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Waiting Too Long to Enjoy Life</h2>\n<p>They waited too long, thinking, <em>once I retire, then I’ll live</em>. By the time that freedom arrives, life isn’t the same. The joints are weaker, relationships are more distant, and the energy isn’t quite what it used to be. Never say <em>once I’m here, then</em>. If you can’t find joy today, you’re not going to find it tomorrow just because you don’t have to go to the office.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
