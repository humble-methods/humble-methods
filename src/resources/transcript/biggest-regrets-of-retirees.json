  "content": "<h1>The 3 Biggest Regrets of Retirees</h1>\n<p>If any of this resonates with you, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Money is a Tool, Not the Goal</h2>\n<p>Many retirees realize too late that money is just a tool, not the goal. Attaining that tool itself doesn't solve anything. In fact, most retirees feel more discouraged when they wake up one day, realize they've reached that magic number they've been working toward, and still have to figure out what to do with their day and how to spend their hours in a fulfilling way.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Fear of Running Out of Money</h2>\n<p>Even after hitting that magic number, many retirees are still terrified of running out. Even those with millions share this fear. Questions swirl: Will it be enough? Should I keep saving? Should I work another year? What if the market tanks right when I retire? While many of us have been taught how to save and invest, fewer have learned how to spend and enjoy their wealth without fear.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Wishing They Had Enjoyed Life More</h2>\n<p>Retirees often look back and wish they'd spent more time enjoying life and less time worrying about money. Seriously, nobody reaches <strong>70</strong> and regrets spending a couple extra bucks on a latte. What they truly regret is not having shared more coffees with friends while they had the time and energy. The happiest retirees I know donâ€™t just manage money; they use it for experiences, family, and enjoying a walk in the woods.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Prioritize experiences over material possessions and make the most of your time to ensure a fulfilling retirement.</p>",
