  "content": "<h1>Health Coverage Considerations for Early Retirement</h1>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Determine Your Coverage Duration</h2>\n<p>Start by knowing exactly how many years you want to cover. This seems obvious, but covering a year is drastically different than covering a decade.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Explore Health Insurance Options</h2>\n<p>Next, explore health insurance options via the <strong>health insurance marketplace</strong>. These plans can be expensive but may be subsidized based on your income.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Consider COBRA for Short-Term Coverage</h2>\n<p>If you're just looking for short-term coverage, remember you can take advantage of up to <strong>18 months of COBRA</strong> from a previous employer. Just keep in mind, COBRA can be ridiculously expensive.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Budget for Healthcare Costs Early</h2>\n<p>I would budget for these costs as early as possible, using either a <strong>health savings account (HSA)</strong> or a taxable brokerage account in your 40s or 50s to earmark a health portfolio that's placed in increasingly conservative investment vehicles as you approach the point of needing to bridge that gap.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Ask Your Spouse to Keep Working</h2>\n<p>Or for the easiest option, just ask your spouse to keep working. Just make sure you ask really nicely!</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>By planning your healthcare coverage strategically, you can alleviate financial stress in retirement. If you have questions or want more insights, feel free to reach out!</p>",
