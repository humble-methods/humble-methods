  "content": "<h1>Three Simple Steps to Become a Millionaire Before Your Friends</h1>\n<p>If you want to become a millionaire before all of your friends, then you need to do the following three things starting right now.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open Up a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Do this through Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard. It\u2019ll take you just five minutes. It\u2019s not some binding commitment, as you can take back your contributions at any point in time if you change your mind, because the account is funded with post-tax dollars.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Automate Contributions</h2>\n<p>Set up automatic contributions to that Roth IRA, starting with $50 to $100 a month. If you deduct those contributions directly from your paycheck, you\u2019ll never have to see them, and you'll learn to live on less. The most valuable wealth-building tool you could ever have is just learning to live on less.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest Your Money</h2>\n<p>Remember that once the money is in your Roth IRA, it\u2019s just sitting in cash. You need to invest it. While I will never tell you exactly how to invest, many experts, including Jack Bogle, the former CEO of Vanguard, recommend considering a combination of a U.S. stock market fund, an international stock market fund, and a total bond market fund. This way, you've invested in just about the entire world.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I can\u2019t make you do it, and I don\u2019t really want to pressure you. It\u2019s your choice. But if you truly start today, you\u2019ll get there.</p>",
