  "content": "<h1>Investing $1 Million in Your 50s or 60s: Smart Strategies for Financial Independence</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how I would invest $1 million if I were in my 50s or 60s. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Remember the 4% Rule</h2>\n<p>Before I invest anything, I would remind myself of the <strong>4% rule</strong>. We can usually be safe taking up to 4% of our portfolio for annual spending without eating too much into the principal. Unfortunately, $40,000 a year is just not gonna do it for me. So, I would invest 100% in stocks and look to live off of <strong>8% to 9%</strong> annually.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Smart Stock Investments</h2>\n<p>To accomplish my first goal, I would invest <strong>$500,000</strong> directly into stable dividend stocks like <em>Verizon</em>, <em>ExxonMobil</em>, or <em>Johnson & Johnson</em>. Alternatively, I could make it easier on myself and just put all of it into a <strong>dividend ETF</strong> like Schwab's <strong>SCHD</strong>. I would invest the remaining <strong>$500,000</strong> in growth stocks like <em>Tesla</em>, <em>NVIDIA</em>, and <em>AMD</em>, to continue building my net worth. I'm 60; I'm not dead!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Adjusting for Cash Flow</h2>\n<p>If I ultimately decided I needed a higher cash flow to keep up with my extravagant purchases of white t-shirts at Target, I would simply reallocate some of my dividend stocks over to <strong>money market funds</strong> that invest in short-term and relatively safe US treasuries, currently returning around <strong>5%</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
