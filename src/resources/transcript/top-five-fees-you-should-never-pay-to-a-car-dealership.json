  "content": "<h2>Top Five Fees to Avoid at Car Dealerships</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow and I'll keep making lists.</p>\n\n<h3>Number Five: Advertising Fee</h3>\n<p>This fee is for regional and national advertising and is already included in the sticker price. If a dealer tries to charge you this as an extra, just say no.</p>\n\n<h3>Number Four: Extended Warranty Packages</h3>\n<p>I understand that we all have different risk profiles and some people value extra peace of mind. However, make sure you know exactly what you're getting for a few thousand dollars.</p>\n\n<h3>Number Three: Delivery and Preparation Fee</h3>\n<p>You may see this listed as dealer prep, vehicle prep, or pre-delivery inspection. Always contest these fees as they are already part of the destination charge, which should come with a full tank of gas.</p>\n\n<h3>Number Two: Documentation Fee</h3>\n<p>Dealers may charge you hundreds of dollars just to process title and registration. Try negotiating that fee down or ask for something extra in the car.</p>\n\n<h3>Number One: Market Adjustment Fee</h3>\n<p>This fee indicates that a dealer adds money beyond the MSRP. Given the current market, demand is outpacing supply, but remember: this fee is not mandatory and is 100% negotiable. </p>\n\n<p>Again, if any of this is helpful, like and follow and I'll keep putting up lists.</p>",
