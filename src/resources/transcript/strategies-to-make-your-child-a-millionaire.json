  "content": "<h1>Effective Strategies to Make Your Child a Millionaire by 65 Without Giving Them a Million Dollars</h1>\n<p>Want your child to be a millionaire without having to actually give them a million bucks? Here's how it's done.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategies</h2>\n<p>Deposit <strong>$2,000</strong> into a brokerage account on the day that your child is born. Invest in low-cost index funds and never deposit another dime. You will have a million dollars by age <strong>65</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, deposit that same $2,000 into a brokerage account the day they're born. Then, continue to deposit <strong>$100</strong> a month into that same account until they're <strong>18</strong>. Have them take over the monthly contributions. They'll probably be a millionaire by age <strong>45</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Early Work Experience</h2>\n<p>Another effective approach is to have your child start working for you at age <strong>8</strong>. Pay them <strong>$200</strong> a month for their work into a Roth IRA. By age <strong>18</strong>, they'll have about <strong>$38,000</strong>, and a couple million dollars by age <strong>65</strong>. And, they will hopefully know more about the value of a dollar earned.</p>",
