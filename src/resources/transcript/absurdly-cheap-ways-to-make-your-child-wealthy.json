  "content": "<h1>Absurdly Cheap Ways to Build Your Child's Wealth</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Here are three absurdly cheap ways to make your child absurdly wealthy:</p>\n\n<h2>1. UGMA Account for Early Investing</h2>\n<p>Put $100 a week into a UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account. This is a brokerage account for minors, totaling $5,200 a year. Invest in a broad growth ETF like <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/IVW\">IVW</a>, which has historically returned around 10.5% post-inflation. If you do this from birth until they turn 18, you can stop contributing completely. By age 65, that account should be worth approximately $30.6 million. Your total contributions would be $93,600.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Custodial Roth IRA Contributions</h2>\n<p>Have your teenager work summers or part-time jobs and help them contribute $6,000 a year to a custodial Roth IRA, investing in something like Vanguard's <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/small-cap-growth/profile\">VBK</a>. If they manage this from ages 14 to 18 for only five years, they could have around $2.7 million by retirement, entirely tax-free forever. Your total investment during this period would be just $30,000.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Teach Fiscal Responsibility</h2>\n<p>Raise them to be fiscally responsible. At age 18, encourage them to keep investing in the Roth IRA. From 18 to 65, if they contribute $7,000 annually and invest it in <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/small-cap-growth/profile\">VBK</a>, their final sum at 65 could reach approximately $15.8 million, all 100% tax-free. That's enough to buy a house—in cash! Or potentially several houses!</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>All of this wealth could stem from simple tasks like vacuuming your office and smart investment habits.
