  "content": "<h1>Why You Should Consider Buying a New Car Right Now</h1>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. New Potential Tariffs</h2>\n<p>The U.S. has announced potential <strong>25% tariffs</strong> on imported vehicles. This could raise car prices by <strong>$2,500 to $15,000</strong>, depending on where the car and its parts are made. There's a reason dealerships are currently marketing pre-tariff deals. This might be the one time they're not full of baloney!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Certain Models Might Vanish</h2>\n<p>Dealerships already have a low supply on certain minivans and compact models. As automakers adjust production, some cars could be pulled from their lineups altogether. So if you know what you want, find what you wantâ€”it might be time to buy what you want!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Rising Costs of Repairs</h2>\n<p>Even that <strong>10-year-old used beater</strong> might get more expensive. Tariffs on auto parts are coming too, which means repairs and insurance could, and will, rise. So whether you're buying new, used, or holding tight, your costs may go up.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So if you're in the market and see the right car at the right price, buy it before someone else beats you to it!</p>",
