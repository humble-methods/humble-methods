  "content": "<h1>My Investment Strategy for 2025: A Simple and Effective Approach</h1>\n<p>No gatekeeping here. Here\u2019s exactly how I invest my money in <strong>2025</strong> as a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I'm Tyler, and I now create financial content for free to help you make informed investment decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. S&P 500 Index Funds and ETFs</h2>\n<p>I have <strong>70%</strong> of my net worth split between one <strong>S&P 500 index fund</strong> and one <strong>S&P 500 exchange-traded fund (ETF)</strong>. Yes, there is some overlap, but ETFs are slightly more liquid in the super short term.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Investment in Growth Fund</h2>\n<p>Next, I allocate <strong>10%</strong> of my net worth to a growth fund that tracks the <strong>NASDAQ</strong>. At <strong>41 years old</strong> with about a <strong>20-year time horizon</strong> until I think I\u2019ll need that money, I can afford to take on some additional risk, so I do.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Emerging Markets Fund</h2>\n<p>I have <strong>5%</strong> of my money in an <strong>emerging markets fund</strong> just in case China and India decide to actually emerge.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Small Cap Fund</h2>\n<p>Another <strong>5%</strong> of my money is in a <strong>small-cap fund</strong>. Remember, companies like Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft were once just small caps, and now they're grown-up caps. It would have been great to be on that ride from the beginning.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Money Market Fund for Liquidity</h2>\n<p>Finally, I keep <strong>10%</strong> of my money in a <strong>money market fund</strong> for liquidity, which is currently returning a very healthy yield for a risk-free asset class.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Simple Management</h2>\n<p>So, that\u2019s six funds with no nonsense, minimal fees, and tax efficiency. It takes me about <strong>10 minutes a year</strong> to rebalance if I wanted to, but for the last five years, I haven\u2019t felt the need.</p>\n\n<p>If you find this helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
