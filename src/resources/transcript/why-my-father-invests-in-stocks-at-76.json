  "content": "<h1>Why My 76-Year-Old Father Remains Fully Invested in Stocks</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create <strong>financial content</strong> for free so that you don't have to pay for it. Today, I want to share why my father, at the age of 76, is still 100% invested in stocks.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Expected Growth of Stocks</h2>\n<p>Firstly, he understands that stocks are expected to grow at an average rate of <strong>8% per year</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Dividend Returns</h2>\n<p>Secondly, by investing in <strong>dividend stocks</strong>, he can achieve around <strong>3.5% returns</strong> from dividends alone each year. This means he can responsibly sell off <strong>4%</strong> of his stocks to support his lifestyle while knowing his portfolio can still grow at <strong>4% per year</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Future Portfolio Value</h2>\n<p>Moreover, he knows that his portfolio will likely be worth <strong>three times</strong> the initial investment in just <strong>15 years</strong>. The dividends will comfortably cover his expenses, while his money grows indefinitely at that <strong>8% annual rate</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Historical Market Performance</h2>\n<p>Lastly, he\u2019s assessed the reality that even if the market experiences its worst 20 years in history, returning only <strong>4% per year</strong>, he would have ended up in the same position had he invested 100% in bonds.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Moral of the Story</h2>\n<p>The key takeaway is this: before you take someone else's word on your investment allocation strategy, it\u2019s crucial to crunch the numbers yourself. Understand what is truly right for you and your <strong>risk tolerance</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this resonated with you, please <strong>like</strong> and <strong>follow</strong>. I will continue to help you get closer to your financial goals.</p>",
