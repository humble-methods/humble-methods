  "content": "<h1>Why You Should Be Skeptical of Self-Proclaimed Money Experts</h1>\n<p>Here is why I wouldn't listen to 99% of self-proclaimed money experts on social media. I'm Tyler, self-proclaimed money expert, and now I make content calling out other self-proclaimed money experts.</p>\n\n<h2>One-Size-Fits-All Solutions</h2>\n<p>Number one, they often prescribe a <strong>one-size-fits-all</strong> solution to all of your problems. The thing is, you're not the person sitting next to you. Even if you're the exact same age, you don't have the same needs, wants, or risk tolerance. <em>Strike one.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Marketing vs. Money Expertise</h2>\n<p>Number two, they're not money experts, they're <strong>marketing experts</strong>. So if you do wanna learn something from them, learn how they're marketing, not what they're marketing. <em>Strike two.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Selling Courses for Real Expert Advice</h2>\n<p>Number three, they're selling you a course or a subscription service in order for you to access their real expert advice. Well, here’s some real expert advice from someone who’s actually managed money for a living:</p>\n<p>If you really wanna be the first millionaire in your family, position yourself as a money expert. Make some videos on social media and sell a course to suckers, teaching them how to sell a course to suckers.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>And in closing, I'm no money expert. Don't ever look at me as one, but I do know <strong>BS</strong> when I see it.</p>",
