  "content": "<h1>The Cost of Not Contributing to Your 401k</h1>\n<p>I don't know who needs to hear this right now, but if you make <strong>$75,000 a year</strong> and for some reason have decided not to contribute to your 401k, even though you've got a <strong>4% company match</strong>, here's what you're missing out on. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Over 10 Years</h2>\n<p>You're missing out on <strong>$41,000 of free money</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Over 20 Years</h2>\n<p>You're missing out on <strong>$122,000 of free money</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Over 30 Years</h2>\n<p>You're missing out on <strong>$283,000 of free money</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Over 40 Years</h2>\n<p>You're missing out on <strong>$598,000 of free money</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>None of that's including your own contributions. Add that in, and you would have had around <strong>$1.2 million</strong> in 40 years of investing. I get itâ€”some people don't like free money. Well, maybe I don't get it. Let me know in the comments if you don't contribute to a 401k and why.</p>",
