  "content": "<h1>Financial Essentials for Women in Their 40s: What You Need to Do Right Now</h1>\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Start Investing Now</h2>\n<p>Women, on average, start investing later than men, which means less time for <strong>compounding</strong>. So open a <strong>brokerage account</strong> today. Choose from Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard—pick one. It doesn’t matter, just start!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest Consistently</h2>\n<p>Now, invest <strong>$100 a week</strong> into a low-cost ETF like Vanguard's <strong>VOO</strong>. Do that until you’re <strong>65</strong>, and you’ll have over a <strong>half million dollars</strong> to kickstart your retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Talk About Money</h2>\n<p>Talk about money! Women negotiate less and invest less, but research shows that the more reps you get, the more confident you become. If money's the muscle, you need to work it out.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Save More Than Men</h2>\n<p>Men are often told to save and invest <strong>10%</strong> of their paycheck. You need to aim closer to <strong>15%</strong> because you live longer and, statistically, you earn less.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Make Your Cash Work for You</h2>\n<p>If you’re still keeping cash in a regular savings account earning the national average of <strong>0.47%</strong>, at least kick it over to a high-yield account where you can earn about <strong>10 times</strong> that. It's like free money for doing nothing!</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So stop waiting, start investing, and remember, your 40s are not too late. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week, I’ll send you over a money playbook that actually works.</p>",
