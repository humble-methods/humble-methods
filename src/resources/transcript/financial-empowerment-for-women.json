Prioritize Your Career</h2>\n<p>First, do not sacrifice your career for his. There\u2019s a <strong>50%</strong> chance that you will get a divorce or be separated. Even in the best-case scenario, you could wind up with <strong>50%</strong> of the assets, but you won\u2019t gain <strong>50%</strong> of his decade of career growth and opportunities.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Ensure Financial Transparency</h2>\n<p>Make sure you and your partner have equal access and visibility to all shared accounts. This includes insurance, mortgage information, investment accounts, and any debt you carry as a family. If your partner tries to gaslight you, claiming you\u2019re crazy for not trusting them with this information, remember this is a form of financial abuse. There are resources available to help guide you through these conversations.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Schedule Regular Financial Check-Ins</h2>\n<p>Finally, have a <strong>financial date night</strong> once a month. This date should be devoted entirely to discussing money\u2014your dreams, your hopes, and your fears. Not only will this give you both an opportunity to discuss finances when things are going well, but it\u2019ll also create space for him to admit that he doesn\u2019t have all the answers. After all, he was raised in a society that suggests he should.</p>\n\n<p>Taking these steps will put you on a solid path toward financial empowerment and closer to achieving your millionaire goals!</p>",
