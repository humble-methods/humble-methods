  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $2 Million in a Recession</h1>\n<p>Here’s how I might invest <strong>$2 million</strong> in a recession as a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in T-Bills for Liquidity</h2>\n<p>First, I’d allocate <strong>$400,000</strong> into <strong>T-bills</strong> through a fund like <strong>S-gov</strong> for liquidity and potential buying opportunities. Having cash allows you to buy low when others are still panicking.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Spread Across Defensive Sectors</h2>\n<p>Next, I’d put <strong>$800,000</strong> spread across consumer staples through a fund like <strong>VDC</strong>, healthcare through a fund like <strong>XLV</strong>, and utilities through a fund like <strong>XLU</strong>. These sectors tend to stay strong even during downturns as people still buy food, pay bills, and get medical care. Alternatively, investing in a dividend ETF like <strong>VYM</strong> will keep paying dividends even if the underlying stock price depreciates.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Real Estate Investment</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>$600,000</strong> in real estate through real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Vanguard's <strong>VNQ</strong> or other private real estate funds. Rental income typically remains steady, and real estate serves as a hedge against inflation.</p>\n\n<h2>4. S&P 500 for Recovery</h2>\n<p>Finally, I’d put <strong>$200,000</strong> in the good old S&P 500 through a fund like <strong>VOO</strong> for the inevitable recovery. You don’t ever want to be left on the sidelines holding <strong>100%</strong> risk-off assets.</p>\n\n<p>These strategies can help you navigate through a recession while positioning your portfolio for long-term growth. If you found this information helpful, please like and follow, and I’ll continue sharing insights to help you reach your financial goals.</p>",
