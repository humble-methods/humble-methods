  "content": "<h1>Investing Based on When You Need the Money: A Strategic Approach</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. For Zero to Two Years</h2>\n<p>Invest 100% in cash or bonds. Consider using <strong>BND</strong> or <strong>SGOV</strong>. Do not put short-term money in stocks. I don't care if the market's up 30%. You need stability, not growth.</p>\n\n<h2>2. For Two to Seven Years</h2>\n<p>Allocate 50% in stocks through <strong>VTI</strong> or <strong>VOO</strong>, and 50% in bonds or cash through <strong>BND</strong> or <strong>SGOV</strong>. Work backwards towards when you need the money. By year seven, you could be 100% in stocks, as long as by year two, you're 100% in bonds or cash.</p>\n\n<h2>3. For Seven Plus Years</h2>\n<p>If you need the money in seven or more years, or don't know when you would need it, invest 100% in stocks through a total stock market fund like <strong>VTI</strong> or a growth fund like <strong>VUG</strong>. You have time for the volatility to smooth out and expect higher returns overall. Again, work backwards. By year two, be 100% in bonds or cash.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
