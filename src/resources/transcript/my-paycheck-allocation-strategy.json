  "content": "<h1>How I Allocate My Paycheck Before It Hits My Checking Account</h1>\n<p>I\u2019m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free so you don\u2019t have to pay for it. Here\u2019s exactly what I do with my paycheck before it even touches my checking account.</p>\n\n<h2>1. SEP IRA Contributions</h2>\n<p><strong>10%</strong> goes directly to my <strong>SEP IRA</strong> and is invested in a low-cost index fund, specifically <strong>FXAIX</strong>. I don\u2019t care whether the markets are up or down; as a small business owner, I can put up to <strong>20%</strong> of my net earnings into that account annually and let it grow tax-deferred for the next <strong>30 years</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Taxable Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p><strong>5%</strong> of my check goes directly into my <strong>taxable brokerage account</strong> and is invested in either <strong>FXAIX</strong> or Fidelity's <strong>money market fund (SPAXX)</strong>. Right now, I can get about <strong>4.5%</strong> return on the equivalent of a risk-free asset.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Reinvesting in My Business</h2>\n<p><strong>50%</strong> of that check goes directly back into my business. Currently in a growth phase, I have to sacrifice some short-term consumption for the hope of long-term gain. Reinvesting in your business is a quick way to achieve a guaranteed <strong>25% to 30%</strong> return in the form of a tax break.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Personal Expenses</h2>\n<p>The remaining <strong>35%</strong> is used to buy a few giant sandwiches here and there at Jersey Mike's and to fill up my gas tank so I can go out in public. Only to inevitably remember that I hate going out in public\u2014hence my walks in the woods.</p>\n\n<p>If you find any of this information helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
