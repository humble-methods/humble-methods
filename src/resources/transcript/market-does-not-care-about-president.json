I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p><h2>1. The Market's Indifference</h2><p>The market does not care who our president is. It never has, it never will.</p><h2>2. Investment Strategy Consistency</h2><p>Regarding your investment strategy, you should never care who our president is, as your long-term asset allocation strategy does not need to change based on who's delivering the state of the union.</p><h2>3. Long-Term Perspectives</h2><p>Regardless of who sits in office, remember that every single person sitting in those elected seats will one day have to retire. It is in none of their best interest to hinder the long-term growth of the U.S. economy or the U.S. markets.</p><p>Today's a good day for action, so get out and vote. Today's also a good day for inaction, as there is no need to touch your long-term investment plan.</p>",
