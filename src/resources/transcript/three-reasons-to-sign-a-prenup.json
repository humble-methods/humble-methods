  "content": "<h1>3 Reasons You Need to Sign a Prenup</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Basic Math</h2>\n<p>50% of first marriages, <strong>60%</strong> of second marriages, and <strong>73%</strong> of third marriages end in divorce. That's not pessimism; that's knowing the divorce house always wins.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Easier Negotiations</h2>\n<p>It’s much easier to negotiate hard things while you’re still laughing at each other’s jokes than it is when you’re sending each other passive-aggressive Venmo requests.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Protecting Your Assets</h2>\n<p>Prenups aren’t just tools for D-bags to keep the rich rich. They can protect your retirement accounts, your grandmother's engagement ring, and yes—they can even clarify who gets the dog. Trust me, that’s real!</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>A prenup isn't romance-killing; it’s about making sure you can still wave to one another when you pass each other at the local flea market.</p>",
