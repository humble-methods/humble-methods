  "content": "<p>Son, I'd like to give you my number one piece of financial retirement advice. <strong>Don't care.</strong> That's the problem with your generation.</p> <p>No, Dad. That's the problem with your generation. We care about <strong>inflation</strong>. Do you have any idea what it's like to live off of a <strong>$40,000 salary</strong> that has the purchasing power of a nickel?</p> <p>Care about <strong>student loan repayment</strong> restarting? How much did you pay for college back in the 50s? That's what I thought.</p> <p>97% of us want to pursue our goals right now. When we're all old and 100% of us are tired of hearing from people like you with old values for old generations.</p> <p>Well, okay then. We like corn, Dad. We just like corn. It's the most beautiful thing.</p>",
