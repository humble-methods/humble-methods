  "content": "<h1>Three Crucial Money Lessons I Wish I Knew at 20</h1>\n<p>I know this is probably going to be controversial, but I just turned 40 years old the other day. I think that finally gives me credibility to speak some truth to a younger generation, or it just lumps me in with all the boomers. Either way, here are the three things that I would do completely differently with money if I got to be 20 years old again.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest Early</h2>\n<p>Number one, I would invest $3 to $4 a day into a brokerage account or a Roth IRA. I would invest it in low-cost index funds and let compound growth do the rest. The worst part is, I had that $3 to $4 a day. I really believe you have that $3 to $4 a day. Put it in that brokerage account, set it and forget it, and you'd be a millionaire by 65.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Give Up Alcohol</h2>\n<p>Number two, I would have given up drinking in my 20s. It took me way too long in life to realize that just wasn't the answer. Not to mention, if you're really wondering where that $3 to $4 a day comes from, the average millennial is spending about $300 a month right now on booze. I probably spent $500 a month in college on booze. Great stories, but a pretty empty bank account.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Start Creating Content</h2>\n<p>Number three, I would have started creating content. I've only been creating content for seven months, and I got offered $3,000 the other day to make a 30-second video! Not only can you make money working with brands, but it also serves as an online resume for anybody in the world to get to know you. That is a passive asset. If you're consuming content right now, you can be creating content. Make your first video today, tag me in it, and I'll give you any and all feedback I can for free. You can do this.</p>",
