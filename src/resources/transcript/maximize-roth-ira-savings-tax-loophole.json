  "content": "<h1>How to Maximize Your Roth IRA Contributions Using a 529 College Savings Plan</h1>\n<p>Here's exactly how you can max out your Roth IRA for seven years in a row, even though you make too much money to do so. I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 1: Open a 529 College Savings Plan</h2>\n<p>First, open a <strong>529 college savings plan</strong> and fund it with <strong>$12,000</strong>. Make sure to invest it accordingly for optimal growth.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 2: Name Yourself as the Beneficiary</h2>\n<p>Next, name yourself as the beneficiary. This is a legit strategy, as there are no restrictions preventing you from doing this.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 3: Roll Over to Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>In <strong>15 years</strong>, when that account has grown to around <strong>$35,000</strong> through the power of compound growth, you can begin to roll over up to <strong>$7,000</strong> a year, or up to the annual limit, into your own IRA.</p>\n\n<p>Don't worry\u2014there are no income limits on 529 conversions to a Roth IRA. Learning about a tax loophole like this can often be more valuable than a college degree.</p>",
