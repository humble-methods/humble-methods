  "content": "<h1>Three Easiest Ways to Become a Millionaire in Your 20s</h1>\n<p>If you are in your 20s, and you really want to become a millionaire, here are the three easiest ways to get you there.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. The first step is to open a Roth IRA with Schwab, Vanguard, or any other brokerage of your choice. It doesn\u2019t matter who you choose, and I don\u2019t get paid to promote anyone in particular. The important thing is that you open the account.</p>\n<p>Here's the cool part: all the money you make on your investments over the next 40 to 50 years will be 100% tax-free after age 59 and a half. Yes, that\u2019s pretty cool!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Fund Your Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Now that the account is open, you need to put money into the Roth IRA. You can do this by transferring funds from your bank account. Personally, I recommend automating this step to ensure you never forget to do it. Also, this prevents you from thinking, \u201cThis week I\u2019d rather take that $50 and go out to eat.\u201d Remember, that $50 is not for you; it\u2019s for your future self.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest Your Money</h2>\n<p>Now that your account is open and funded, it\u2019s time to do what most people do not do: invest that money. You could choose stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs. I know I can\u2019t beat the market regularly, even as a former portfolio manager, so I invest in low-cost index funds that track the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ. This approach is diversified, easy, and cheap.</p>\n\n<p>And that\u2019s it! If you commit to investing just $50 a week starting around age 20, you\u2019ll find yourself with a million bucks sooner than you know it. Most importantly, you\u2019ll gain the confidence that you are in control of your financial future, taking one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
