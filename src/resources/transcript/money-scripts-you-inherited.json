  "content": "<h1>3 Money Scripts You Inherited Without Even Knowing It</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Fear of Checking Your Bank Account</h2>\n<p>Maybe your parents fought every time a bill came. Now you avoid checking your bank account like it's radioactive.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Guilt Over Spending</h2>\n<p>Or maybe you grew up hearing, <em>“We can’t afford that,”</em> even when you could. As a result, you feel guilty every time you buy something that brings you joy.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Money Scripts as Operating Systems</h2>\n<p>Money scripts are like operating systems. You didn’t choose them, but they run in the background and can crash your financial decisions when you least expect it.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you want to change your money behavior, start by rewriting the script you didn’t even know you were reading from.</p>",
