  "content": "<h1>3 Reasons to Consider Roth Conversions Before Hitting RMD Age</h1>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Future Taxes Are a Wild Card</h2>\n<p>You might be in a lower tax bracket because of reduced income, but you might also find yourself in an increased bracket if tax rates go up. The government controls the tax brackets, not you. A Roth conversion locks in known rates rather than gambling on the future.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Avoiding Higher Tax Brackets Due to RMDs</h2>\n<p>Once RMDs kick in at age 73, it can push you into a higher tax bracket, increasing taxes on Social Security and even Medicare premiums. By converting to a Roth before RMDs, you can reduce your future taxable income and keep more of your money.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Legacy Planning Power</h2>\n<p>Heirs inheriting pre-tax accounts have 10 years to drain them and must pay taxes on the withdrawals. With Roth IRAs, there are no RMDs and tax-free withdrawals. If you want to pass on wealth efficiently later, the conversion might be a no-brainer now. Paying taxes upfront sucks, no doubt, but a well-planned Roth conversion is a hedge against future uncertainty.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
