  "content": "<h1>5 Steps to Retire Earlier and Secure Your Financial Future</h1>\n<p>Here is a five-step plan to retire earlier. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you achieve your retirement goals.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Commit to Saving 25% of Your Income</h2>\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s hard, and yes, it\u2019s worth it. Make it a priority to save <strong>25%</strong> of your income.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in Low-Cost Index Funds</h2>\n<p>Now invest that <strong>25%</strong> in <strong>low-cost index funds</strong>. Focus on total stock or total bond markets to balance your portfolio.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Maintain Investment Percentages</h2>\n<p>Keep what you invest in percentage terms. As you make more, you should invest more to maintain your saving consistency.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Calculate Your Retirement Needs</h2>\n<p>Multiply how much money you want to live off each year in retirement by <strong>20</strong>. This gives you an idea of the target amount you need to have saved by retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Draw Down Wisely</h2>\n<p>Once you hit that target number, you can retire and feel good about drawing down about <strong>5%</strong> per year, most likely never running out of money in retirement.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
