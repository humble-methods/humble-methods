  "content": "<h1>Should You Pay Down Your Mortgage or Invest $1,000 a Month?</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Mathematically, Investing Usually Wins</h2>\n<p>If your mortgage interest rate is <strong>3%</strong> and the market returns an average real rate of <strong>7%</strong>, it's basic math to conclude that investing usually wins.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Behavior Beats Math</h2>\n<p>However, in finance, behavior often trumps math. If you hate debt or know you'll sleep better with the house paid off entirely, paying it off can be the best risk-adjusted return for you.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Consider a Balanced Approach</h2>\n<p>You could also choose to split the difference. Allocate a little extra to the principal each month while investing the rest. Remember, personal finance can be personal and strategic. It’s not about perfection; it’s about building wealth in a way that makes you feel good while living your life.</p>",
