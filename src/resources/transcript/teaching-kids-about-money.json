  "content": "<h1>How to Teach Your Kids About Money Without the Lecture</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Show Them, Don't Tell Them</h2>\n<p>Kids learn spending habits early by watching how you <strong>tip, save, and swipe</strong>. Don’t forget, those comments you’re making at the dinner table when they’re young? They hear that!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Give Them Real Money to Manage</h2>\n<p>A <strong>$50 allowance</strong> gives them more than <strong>50 lectures</strong> on compound interest. Let them handle real money to learn its value and how to manage it wisely.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Involve Them in Financial Conversations</h2>\n<p>Involve them early in your financial conversations. Age-appropriate transparency turns money from taboo into something normal. We all know how much we need to normalize talking about money.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, go talk to your kids about money!</p>",
