  "content": "<h1>Money: More Than Just Math—It’s Identity, Memory, and Meaning</h1>\n<p>If an advisor ever opens with, <strong>\"Trust me, I'll beat the stock market,\"</strong> I would run. That line is a relic from the 1980s, like a Wall Street VHS tape stuck on repeat. It's not just outdated; it is a massive red flag.</p>\n\n<p>Decades of academic research have made it abundantly clear: most advisors do not beat the market over time, especially after fees. The best advisors aren't trying to be magicians; they're trying to be mirrors. They reflect your values and keep your future self from sabotaging your present one.</p>\n\n<p>And in the long run, that will beat any market.</p>",
