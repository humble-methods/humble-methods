  "content": "<h1>How to Buy or Lease a Vehicle Smartly</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I make financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Email Three Dealerships</h2>\n<p>Start by contacting three dealerships and inform them that you are talking to competitors. Insist that you will not step foot in the store until you have the out-the-door price locked in writing. They should provide you with the price via email. If they refuse, move on to another dealer.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Time Your Purchase</h2>\n<p>Buy at the end of the month or the end of the year. Dealers often have sales quotas and need to hit specific numbers, so they are more willing to negotiate during these times. For instance, December 30th might give you more leverage than July 12th.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Look for Cars Already on the Lot</h2>\n<p>Inquire about vehicles that are already on the dealership lot. Don't worry about the color; the dealer just wants to sell a car that’s incurring costs every day it sits unsold. This can give you an advantage when negotiating.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Avoid Talking Monthly Payments</h2>\n<p>Never discuss monthly payments. Focusing on payments can lead to longer loan terms, higher interest rates, and unfavorable residual values. Only negotiate the total purchase price, as that is all that truly matters.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Separate Each Deal</h2>\n<p>Negotiate each aspect of the deal—trade-in, financing, and purchase price—individually. If you bundle the deals, the dealer might offer you a great price on your trade-in while inflating the overall purchase price.</p>\n\n<p>By following these five rules, you'll likely walk out with a better deal than 95% of car buyers. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
