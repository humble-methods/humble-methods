  "content": "<h1>The Next Big Thing in Financial Planning: Convenient and Stress-Free Solutions</h1>\n<p>I'm calling it now—this will be the next big thing, kind of like oat milk. We're sleeping eight hours a night. It’s called <strong>financial planning</strong> that doesn’t make you want to scream into a filing cabinet.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Old Way Was a Paper Chase</h2>\n<p>Remember when financial planning meant an accordion folder, a fax machine, and some guy named Gary who made you drive <strong>45 minutes</strong> to his office just to tell you to <strong>spend less</strong> and <strong>diversify</strong>? We were basically paying for adult homework.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Convenience Now Has Wi-Fi</h2>\n<p>With Facet, you can meet with a CFP professional from your couch. <strong>No suits, no traffic</strong>, and no waiting rooms with a bowl of mints older than your kids!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Real Access, Real Advice</h2>\n<p>No mountains of paperwork here. If you have a question, you don’t have to wait six weeks for Chad to get back from vacation; you just message them like it’s <strong>2025</strong>, which it is, by the way.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So go to <strong>facet.com/tyler</strong> to get started today. Enjoy a flat membership fee, modern advice, and say goodbye to paper cuts and guilt trips.</p>",
