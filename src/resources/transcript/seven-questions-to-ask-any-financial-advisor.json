  "content": "<h1>7 Questions to Ask Any Financial Advisor Before You Work With Them</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out the full episode of the podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. What Are Your Credentials?</h2>\n<p>All credentials are not created equal. And even if you have credentials, it still might be a ding dong.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Are You a Fiduciary?</h2>\n<p>This means they're legally supposed to put your interests first, but even the devil can cite scripture for their own purposes.</p>\n\n<h2>3. How Do You Get Paid?</h2>\n<p>If it's a percentage of your assets, they get paid more if you do better, but also if you do worse or do absolutely nothing.</p>\n\n<h2>4. What Will You Do With My Money?</h2>\n<p>Index funds? You can do that. Stock picking? That doesn't work. Make sure it's a strategy you can't or don't want to do on your own.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Will You Teach Me?</h2>\n<p>Because if they're just there to confuse you and pretend that you can't understand the language without them, just so they stay relevant, they're not worth your time.</p>\n\n<h2>6. What Value Beyond Investment Returns Are You Offering?</h2>\n<p>Because they're not beating the market anytime soon, so they better be there to protect you from the single most dangerous thing in investing: your own emotions.</p>\n\n<h2>7. How Do You Invest Your Own Money?</h2>\n<p>They don't have to answer this one, but if they don't or they're not buying what they're selling, that's your sign.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>And again, if you want to go into any more detail on this, which you should, check out this week's episode on the podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link.</p>",
