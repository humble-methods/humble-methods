I can take out that entire $4 million after I retire <strong>100% tax-free</strong>.</p><p>Well, you can't touch that money until you're 59 and a half.</p><p>No, it's a Roth IRA. I can take back my contributions whenever I want and spend them however I want.</p><p>Well, you better start taking those <strong>RMDs</strong> by 72 so we'll get our taxes then.</p><p>I don't ever have to take RMDs. So what happens with all that money?</p><p>It just keeps growing and growing. That's why I plan on giving it to my kids when I die.</p><p>By then it will probably be worth closer to $12 million.</p><p>Well, we'll take our estate tax then.</p><p>Not if it's under $12.06 million, you won't. <em>Lifetime exemption</em>.</p><p>So we get nothing.</p>",
