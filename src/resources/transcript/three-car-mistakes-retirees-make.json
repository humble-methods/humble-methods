  "content": "<h1>3 Mistakes Retirees Make When It Comes to Cars</h1>\n<p>You might wanna hear this one.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Thinking You Need a Brand New Car Every Few Years</h2>\n<p>Any retirees who reward themselves with a new car every few years are making a big mistake. It's a depreciating asset, not an investment, and it destroys wealth very quickly. Most cars lose about <strong>50%</strong> of their value within five years.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Paying Cash for a Car When Interest Rates Are Low</h2>\n<p>A lot of retirees think that now that they have cash, they should just use it to buy everything. But if interest rates are at <strong>4%</strong>, keep some cash invested in the stock market growing at <strong>7%</strong>. Come on, you know this!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Overspending on Cars Instead of Prioritizing Experience</h2>\n<p>I get itâ€”cars can be part of an experience. But remember, cars are an expense! The happiest retirees I know prioritize true experiences over material possessions.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this resonates with you, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
