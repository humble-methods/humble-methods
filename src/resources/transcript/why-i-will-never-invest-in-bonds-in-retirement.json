  "content": "<h1>Why I Will Never Invest in Bonds in Retirement</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Low Returns</h2>\n<p>Over the last century, bonds have generated about a <strong>5%</strong> return pre-inflation. That equates to only <strong>2%</strong> post-inflation and <strong>1%</strong> post-tax. I would wind up earning even less than my neighbor's illegal maple moonshine operation!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Longevity Risk</h2>\n<p>Let’s face it—you’re going to live to <strong>95</strong>. Bonds might not even be able to keep up with your grocery bill, especially if you shop at the co-op.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Basic Math</h2>\n<p>Over every <strong>20-year</strong> period in history, stocks have outperformed bonds. Need I say more?</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you want a deeper dive, check out episode <strong>7</strong> of my podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
