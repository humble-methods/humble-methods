  "content": "<h1>Smart Strategies to Minimize Your Tax Burden on $70,000 Income</h1>\n<p>Here's a quick way to avoid paying taxes on 47% of your income this year. Let's break it down with a few strategic steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Assumed Income:</strong> We're starting with an assumption of $70,000 in annual income.</li>\n<li><strong>Traditional IRA Contribution:</strong> Contribute $7,000 into a traditional IRA. This will reduce our taxable income to $63,000.</li>\n<li><strong>401k Contribution:</strong> Next, we contribute another $7,000 into a 401k. This contribution is pre-tax, bringing our taxable income down to $56,000.</li>\n<li><strong>Health Savings Account:</strong> Additionally, we can put $4,000 into a health savings account, further deducting that contribution and resulting in a taxable income of $52,000.</li>\n<li><strong>Standard Deduction:</strong> But we’re not done! By taking advantage of the single filer standard deduction of $15,000, we can report our income to the government as $37,000. This strategy allows us to shelter all of our income from the 22% tax bracket, allowing us to pay only 12% on most of it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If we follow these steps wisely, we could potentially become multi-millionaires in 35 years, without having to worry about healthcare expenses in the future.</p>\n<p>If any of this information has been helpful, consider signing up for my free newsletter.
