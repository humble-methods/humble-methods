  "content": "<h1>Investing Basics: 3 Essential Tips for Beginners</h1>\n<p>If you want to invest but don’t know how to start, here are the only three things you need to know. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to provide you with valuable insights.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Assess Your Short-Term Financial Needs</h2>\n<p>First, determine how much money you need over the next <strong>one to two years</strong>. If you know you need <strong>X</strong> amount by <strong>Y</strong> time, that money should not pass GO and should be placed directly into a <strong>money market fund</strong>. This option is risk-free, earning up to <strong>4% to 5%</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Plan for Long-Term Investments</h2>\n<p>If you’re uncertain about your financial needs and plan to invest money for the distant future, then that money should pass GO as quickly as possible and go directly into a <strong>low-cost index fund</strong> or <strong>ETF</strong>. If you can do this within a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> or <strong>401(k)</strong> with a company match, even better for maximizing tax advantages.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Take Action Now</h2>\n<p>I don’t know why you’re still here. That’s it: one question, two options. Now get to it! If you find any of this information helpful, sign up for my free newsletter in my bio. Every Sunday, I’ll send you more techniques to help you get one step closer to your financial goals.</p>",
