  "content": "<h1>Investment Strategies for $20,000</h1>\n<p>Here's how I would invest <strong>$20,000</strong> into the stock market as a former <em>portfolio manager</em> and a self-made <em>trillionaire</em> who walks in the woods all day. </p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in a Low-Cost Index Fund</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>$7,000</strong> in a low-cost index fund within a <em>Roth IRA</em> because it\u2019s the max that I can put in each year. This is a retirement account and I\u2019m looking at a <strong>40 to 50 year time horizon</strong> where 100% of my gains\u2014everything I earn on my investments\u2014would be <strong>100% tax-free</strong> after 59 \u00bd. I would treat this like a second emergency fund because I can take back the contributions at any time, penalty and tax-free.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in High Risk, High Reward Tech Fund</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>$2,000</strong> in a high risk, high reward tech fund like <strong>Invesco's QQQM</strong>, <strong>Vanguard's VUG</strong>, or if I were feeling really risky, into a semiconductor fund like <strong>SOXX</strong> or <strong>SHOC</strong>. Again, I have a really long time horizon and I can afford to remain invested through some inevitable market downturns.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in Your Physical and Mental Health</h2>\n<p>I would invest the remaining <strong>$1,000</strong> into my physical health by buying a <em>gym membership</em>. And for my mental health, I\u2019d allocate funds to purchase about <strong>20 books</strong> a year on personal finance, investing, and business strategy. If you are not investing at least <strong>10%</strong> of your assets in your physical and mental wellbeing, it doesn\u2019t matter how much fricking money you have because you\u2019re not going to be operating at your best.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, <strong>like and follow</strong> and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
