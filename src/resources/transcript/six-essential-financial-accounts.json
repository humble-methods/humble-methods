  "content": "<h1>Six Essential Financial Accounts You'll Need for Life</h1>\n<p>Here are the only six accounts you will ever need for the rest of your life. This information is as true today as it will be in 30 years.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Checking Account</h2>\n<p>This is where money comes in and equally quickly goes out. It's just for paying bills, and the balance should always be close to <strong>zero</strong>. Why? Because your money earns almost <strong>zero interest</strong> in this account, and therefore it loses value daily.</p>\n\n<h2>2. High-Yield Savings Account</h2>\n<p>This is where your money should be if you're saving it for a known expense at a known time other than your immediate bills. In other words, you can't afford to have it sitting in the market and risk losing it. You also can't afford to have it be in a checking account losing value daily.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>This is where you invest money that you do not need in the short term, so it can take advantage of <strong>tax-free growth</strong> for the long term. Contribute up to <strong>$7,000</strong> a year, or <strong>$8,000</strong> if you're over 50. Invest the money in low-cost index funds like Vanguard's <strong>VOO</strong> or Fidelity's <strong>FXAIX</strong>, and know that you can take back the contributions anytime, penalty and tax-free if you really need them.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Traditional 401(k)</h2>\n<p>This is where you invest money from your paycheck and do everything you can to get the full employer match. Wall Street will tell you there's no such thing as a free lunch, and that's nonsense; an employer match will buy you a free lunch. Invest the money in low-cost index funds or a target date retirement fund and call it a day.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>The Roth is your post-tax account, and the 401(k) is your pre-tax account. You also want to invest money today that you can touch without penalty before age <strong>59 and a half</strong>. Invest in whatever works for you, but in my brokerage account, I invest in a tax-efficient, low-cost growth fund like Vanguard's <strong>VUG</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Health Savings Account (HSA)</h2>\n<p>If you have a high-deductible health plan, the health savings account is the only <strong>triple-tax-advantaged account</strong> in the world. Contributions are tax-deductible, investments can grow tax-free, and withdrawals are <strong>100% tax-free</strong>, so long as they're spent on qualifying medical expenses.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, Iâ€™ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
