  "content": "<h1>Top 5 Hidden Financial Advisor Fees You Must Watch Out For</h1>\n<p>If you are thinking about working with a financial advisor, here are five fees that you might end up paying if you're not watching closely.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Fund Fees</h2>\n<p>Regardless of how much your advisor charges you for their services, you also will pay the fees of every single fund that they put you in. This can range from <strong>0.05%</strong> for low-cost index funds to upwards of <strong>3%</strong> for some alternative investment mutual funds.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Fund of Fund Fees</h2>\n<p>Even worse, your advisor might get really lazy and just stick your money in a fund that has a bunch of other mutual funds in it. You\u2019re then paying your advisor fee, the fund of funds fee, and all of those funds fee. This could total about <strong>5%</strong> very quickly and give you a <strong>0%</strong> chance of achieving your long-term goals.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Front End Load Fees</h2>\n<p>For some mutual funds, you get charged a hefty fee just to have the privilege of being put into the fund. By law, this can be up to <strong>8.5%</strong> of your initial investment. Think about that; that's a great annual return for the S&P 500, gone because of one fee. These usually range from <strong>3%</strong> to <strong>6%</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Back End Load Fees</h2>\n<p>You can also get charged that same hefty fee when you leave the fund. These range from <strong>5%</strong> to <strong>7%</strong> of your investment. Yes, they do decrease as you spend more time in the fund. But if you want out of that fund quickly, just like annuities, they'll eat you alive.</p>\n\n<h2>5. 12B-1 Fees</h2>\n<p>This is a very common one that <strong>99%</strong> of you are most likely paying. These are fees that are paid directly to your financial advisor for recommending selling certain mutual funds. Yes, they get a kickback. This does seem like a conflict of interest.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
