  "content": "<h1>Why I Don't Track My Spending (And Why It Works Better Than Any Budget)</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Tracking Every Expense is Tedious</h2>\n<p>Tracking every expense is like counting calories by weighing lettuce—I’m going to give up by week three! You start lying to your spreadsheet just to make it easier.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Overspending from Lack of Limits</h2>\n<p>People don’t overspend because they lack tracking; they overspend because they lack limits. I use one simple system: automate my priorities so I can guilt-free spend the rest.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Knowing How Much to Spend</h2>\n<p>I already know exactly how much I can spend each month because I’ve taken care of the saving and investing first. That’s the system! No need to obsess over every dollar with random receipts put in color-coded folders on my refrigerator.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Give your money a job and let it clock in before you do. It’s all about simplifying your financial management!</p>",
