If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Stop Feeling Sorry for Yourself</h2>\n<p>The median retirement account for people aged <strong>50 to 55</strong> in the US is just over <strong>$10,000</strong>. You're not alone in this situation.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Run the Numbers for Yourself</h2>\n<p>With <strong>15 to 20 years</strong> left to work, your best asset isn’t just money; it’s <strong>momentum</strong>. Small increases in saving and investing now can make a massive difference down the road.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Define Your Goal</h2>\n<p>Retirement doesn’t have to mean never working again. Maybe it means part-time work, paid sabbaticals, or slow travel between new projects. It’s not too late, but the longer you wait to start, the fewer options you’ll have.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Start building a plan today that you can live with—literally.</p>",
