  "content": "<h1>Top Three Reasons to Add Bonds to Your Investment Strategy as You Age</h1>\n<p>Here are the <strong>top three reasons why I would add bonds</strong> to my investment strategy as I got older.</p>\n<p>I'm <strong>Tyler</strong>, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>1. Cashflow</h2>\n<p>As we move towards <strong>retirement</strong>, we want some money to live on. And <strong>government</strong>, <strong>corporate</strong>, and <strong>municipal bonds</strong> are a way to generate some income for relatively low risk.</p>\n<h2>2. Relatively Lower Risk Than Stocks</h2>\n<p><strong>Government bonds</strong> are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, for whatever that's worth to you. And <strong>investment grade corporate bonds</strong> are backed by some pretty stable companies.</p>\n<h2>3. Diversification</h2>\n<p>The biggest reason why I personally would add bonds to my portfolio as I got older is not for the return, but rather that bonds, as an asset class, will help diversify your portfolio by adding what's called <strong>non or negative correlation</strong>. This means that if stocks go down, sometimes historically, bonds have moved in the other direction or not moved at all. This can really help decrease the overall loss in your portfolio.</p>",
