  "content": "<h1>How I'd Retire by 50 Without Worrying About Money</h1>\n<p>Here\u2019s exactly how I\u2019d retire by <strong>50 years old</strong> without ever having to worry about money again. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help guide you in your investment decisions.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in Tax-Advantaged Accounts</h2>\n<p>I\u2019d start by investing at least <strong>50%</strong> of my income in <strong>tax-advantaged accounts</strong> such as <strong>Roth IRAs</strong>, <strong>SEP IRAs</strong>, <strong>401(k)s</strong>, and <strong>HSAs</strong>. Why? Because every dollar that I don\u2019t pay in taxes today is an extra dollar that compounds for me for decades.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Focus on Stocks</h2>\n<p>Next, I\u2019d keep <strong>100%</strong> of this money in these accounts invested in <strong>stocks</strong>. No bonds, no real estate, no nonsense. Stocks have outpaced every other asset class over the long run. And just to clarify, no, <strong>crypto</strong> is not an asset class nor has it come close to proving itself over the long term.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Create Multiple Income Streams</h2>\n<p>Finally, I\u2019d make sure I had at least <strong>three to five different streams of income</strong>. The average millionaire has <strong>seven</strong> income streams, while most people trying to retire early want to rely on just one. That\u2019s a mistake. Potential income sources include <strong>dividend stocks</strong>, <strong>rental income</strong>, <strong>small business revenue</strong>, and <strong>intellectual property</strong>. It doesn\u2019t have to be much, but it does need to exist.</p>\n\n<p>Even if I had retired at the peak of the dot-com bubble, data shows that with the right withdrawal strategy, I still would have outperformed <strong>99%</strong> of investors who tried to play it safe.</p>\n\n<p>If this is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
