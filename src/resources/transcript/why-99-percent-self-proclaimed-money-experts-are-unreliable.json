  "content": "<h1>Why 99% of Self-Proclaimed Money Experts on Social Media Are Unreliable</h1> <p>I'm Tyler, a self-proclaimed money expert, and now I make content calling out other self-proclaimed money experts.</p> <h2>1. One Size Fits All Solutions</h2> <p>Number one, they often prescribe a one-size-fits-all solution to all of your problems. The thing is, you're not the person sitting next to you; even if you're the exact same age, you don’t have the same needs, wants, or risk tolerance. <strong>Strike one.</strong></p> <h2>2. Marketing Over Money Management</h2> <p>Number two, they're not money experts, they're marketing experts. So, if you do want to learn something from them, learn how they're marketing, not what they're marketing. <strong>Strike two.</strong></p> <h2>3. The Course and Subscription Trap</h2> <p>Number three, they’re selling you a course or a subscription service in order for you to access their real expert advice. But here’s some real expert advice from someone who's actually managed money for a living:</p> <p>If you really want to be the first millionaire in your family, position yourself as a money expert, make some videos on social media, and sell a course to suckers. Teaching them how to sell a course to suckers.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>In closing, I'm no money expert. Don't ever look at me as one, but I do know BS when I see it.</p>",
