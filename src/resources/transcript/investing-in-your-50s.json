  "content": "<h1>Investing Strategies for Your 50s</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this resonates with you, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Forget Your Age</h2>\n<p>I would start by forgetting about my age and investing based on some archaic formula. Thatâ€™s the wrong place from which to start. You are not the same 50-year-old sitting next to you.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Focus on Lifestyle Sustainability</h2>\n<p>Instead, I would ask only one question: Can I afford to live off of <strong>4% or 5%</strong> of my current asset base?</p>\n\n<h2>3. If Yes, Principal Protection and Wealth Preservation</h2>\n<p>If the answer is yes, then I would focus on creating a portfolio entirely based on principal protection and wealth preservation. An ideal allocation could be: <strong>50%</strong> fixed income, <strong>30%</strong> blue-chip dividend funds, <strong>10%</strong> real estate investment trusts, and <strong>10%</strong> cash equivalents.</p>\n\n<h2>4. If Likely Within 5-10 Years, Balanced Portfolio</h2>\n<p>If the answer was not quite but I probably will be able to in about <strong>5 to 10 years</strong>, I would focus on creating a balanced portfolio that mitigates downside risk while maintaining healthy growth. A possible allocation: <strong>30%</strong> growth stocks, <strong>10%</strong> dividend stocks, <strong>30%</strong> fixed income, <strong>20%</strong> real estate investment trusts, and <strong>10%</strong> cash equivalents.</p>\n\n<h2>5. If a Hard No, Growth Portfolio</h2>\n<p>If the answer was a hard no, then I would continue to focus on a growth portfolio: <strong>50%</strong> growth stocks, <strong>30%</strong> dividend stocks, <strong>10%</strong> fixed income, and <strong>10%</strong> cash equivalents.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>And as always, that's just me. You do you!</p>",
