  "content": "<h1>Should You Borrow Against Your Assets? Here’s What to Consider</h1>\n<p>If you’ve got millions of dollars in assets, here are three reasons I would borrow against them and three reasons I definitely wouldn’t. I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Reasons to Borrow Against Your Assets</h2>\n<h3>1. Liquidity Without Selling</h3>\n<p>I get cash without triggering <strong>capital gains taxes</strong>. Cool.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Lower Potential Rates</h3>\n<p>Asset-backed loans often beat the rates of <strong>credit cards</strong> or <strong>personal loans</strong>. Also cool.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Stay Invested</h3>\n<p>My portfolio keeps compounding while I cover one big expense or opportunity. Very cool, especially if I have millions compounding.</p>\n\n<h2>Reasons Not to Borrow Against Your Assets</h2>\n<h3>1. Market Risk</h3>\n<p>If the market tanks—or when the market tanks—margin calls can force me to sell at the worst times.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Rising Rates</h3>\n<p>Most of these loans are variable, so costs can and do climb quickly.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Overspending Illusion</h3>\n<p>It’s very easy to overspend when borrowing feels painless. But this is not newly minted money; it’s a loan against your assets.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
