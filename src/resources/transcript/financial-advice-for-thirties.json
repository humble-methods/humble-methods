  "content": "<h1>If You're in Your 30s and Feel Financially Behind, Here's What to Do</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Start Investing Now</h2>\n<p>Stop waiting for more money to invest. Saying investing is only for the rich is like saying the gym is only for people who already have six-pack abs. Open a Roth IRA through Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard. Pick one today and get it done!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Automate Your Contributions</h2>\n<p>Automate putting $200 a month into that Roth IRA, investing it in a total stock market fund like Vanguard's VTI. Do this until you're 65, and you'll most likely have about $650,000 in tax-free money. If you don't have $200, do less. Remember, doing less is still better than doing nothing.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Talk About Money with Friends</h2>\n<p>Start having conversations about money with your friends. I know it can be awkward, but what's more awkward is not knowing anything about money because you're uncomfortable discussing it. Organize a weekly dinner to talk about everything from 401k matches to investment tips.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Invest 15% of Your Paycheck</h2>\n<p>Try to invest 15% of each paycheck. The old advice suggested 10%, but that was back when pensions existed and houses were reasonably affordable. Increase it by 1% per year if you need to.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Move Your Cash</h2>\n<p>Move your cash out of poor-performing savings accounts. If your savings earn under 0.5% while inflation is at 3%, you're losing money every day. Protect your purchasing power by moving your cash to a high-yield savings account or a money market fund like S-Gov or SPAXX.</p>\n\n<p>You're in your 30s with over 30 years until retirement. You are not behind, but every day you wait is a day you waste. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
