  "content": "<h1>3 Steps for Women in Their 30s to Grow Wealth Beyond Savings Accounts</h1>\n<p>If you're a woman in your 30s and you want to earn <strong>45 times more</strong> than you're currently earning in your savings account, then you need to do the following three things right now.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Open up a <strong>brokerage account</strong> with platforms like <strong>Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard,</strong> or <strong>Robinhood</strong>. It\u2019ll take you about five minutes, and you never have to use it if you don\u2019t want to. Fund that account with <strong>$20 to $25</strong> a week.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Research Money Market Funds</h2>\n<p>Take five minutes to visit one of the following websites: <strong>NerdWallet</strong> or <strong>Bankrate</strong>. Look up the best <strong>money market funds</strong>. These funds invest in short-term and relatively safe securities and are currently offering about <strong>4.5%</strong> on your cash.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest Wisely</h2>\n<p>If you already have your high-interest credit card debt taken care of, then put that <strong>$20 to $25</strong> into the money market fund. This surely beats the <strong>0.01%</strong> you\u2019re making right now on your savings account with institutions like JP Morgan or Bank of America.</p>\n\n<p>Once you've done that, congratulations! You\u2019re now an investor and one step closer to financial freedom.</p>",
