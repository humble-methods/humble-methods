Just create a private family foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>Child:</strong> What's the catch?</p>\n<p><strong>Dad:</strong> I just have to pay out 5% of the foundation's market value each year to a qualified charity.</p>\n<p><strong>Child:</strong> What happens with the other 95%?</p>\n<p><strong>Dad:</strong> That stays in the foundation and grows for future giving.</p>\n<p><strong>Child:</strong> I like it.</p>\n<p><strong>Dad:</strong> Great, because you're also hired to run the foundation. Oh, and I'm giving you the foundation when I die. Keeping it in the family.</p>\n<p><strong>Dad:</strong> That's philanthropy, son.</p>",
