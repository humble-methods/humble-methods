  "content": "<h1>3 Steps to Earn 33% More Than Your High-Yield Savings Account</h1>\n<p>If you want to earn <strong>33% more</strong> than you’re currently earning in your <strong>high-yield savings account</strong>, here are the three things you need to do today.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Start by opening a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> through Vanguard or a brokerage firm of your choice.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Fund Your Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Fund that Roth IRA with up to <strong>$7,000</strong> if you're under <strong>50</strong>, or <strong>$8,000</strong> if you're over <strong>50</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in a Treasury ETF</h2>\n<p>Invest that money in a risk-free <strong>treasury ETF</strong> like <strong>S-Gov</strong>. This is where you get that <strong>33%</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Understand the Interest Comparison</h2>\n<p>Remember, in your high-yield savings account, your money was taxed. You weren’t really earning <strong>4%</strong>; you were earning closer to <strong>3%</strong>. In the Roth IRA, since it’s a retirement account, you’ll be earning <strong>4%</strong>. Plus, <strong>33%</strong> of your interest is staying in your pocket where it belongs.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each Sunday morning, I'll send over more insights like this.</p>",
