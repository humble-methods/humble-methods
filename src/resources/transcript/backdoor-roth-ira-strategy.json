  "content": "<p><strong>Dad, is it true that you found a way around the Roth IRA income limits of $144,000 a year?</strong></p>\n<p>Yep, backdoor Roth conversion.</p>\n<p><strong>How does that work?</strong></p>\n<p>I contribute to a traditional IRA, no income limits, and I convert to a Roth IRA. Pay taxes now, no taxes later.</p>\n<p><strong>But you'll have to take the money out at some point, right?</strong></p>\n<p>Nope. No required minimum distributions with a Roth. Great for estate planning.</p>\n<p><strong>So why wouldn't everyone do this?</strong></p>\n<p>If you need the money in the next few years, not a great idea. This is usually a long-term strategy for growth.</p>\n<p><strong>And where did you learn all that?</strong></p>\n<p>I just follow Social Cap. He makes complex finance seem easy.</p>",
