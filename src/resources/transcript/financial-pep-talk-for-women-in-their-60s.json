  "content": "<h1>A No-Nonsense Financial Pep Talk for Women in Their 60s</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Start Today</h2>\n<p>It is not too late. The average woman in her 60s will live well into her 80s. That's 20 to 30 years of compounding still ahead. So if you invest $1,000 a month into a low-cost index fund, like Schwab's SWPPX, for 20 years, even a conservative portfolio could double or triple.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Don't Rush Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>As of 2025, required minimum distributions don't start until right after the age of 73, which means your investments can keep quietly working while staying completely tax-efficient and deferred.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Keep Investing Automatically</h2>\n<p>Whether it's 100 bucks a week or 1,000 bucks a month into a simple total market ETF like VTI or a more balanced fund like VBINX, the best time to invest was 40 years ago. The next best time is right now.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Don't Fear Volatility</h2>\n<p>Every retired woman I know simply wishes she had started earlier, not played it safer.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Own a Little Growth</h2>\n<p>A small slice in individual blue chip stocks or a total stock market fund keeps your portfolio activated for growth in the 20 to 30 years ahead. That's how you'll beat inflation over time.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Upgrade That Cash Game</h2>\n<p>Money markets and short-term treasuries are currently paying 4% to 5%. So don't let your cash fund nap in a 0.4% savings account. You have officially earned the right to earn interest, so go get it.</p>\n\n<p>No, it's not too late. No, you’re not too old. And at 80, I promise you one thing: you're gonna wish you'd been invested for the past 20 years. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
