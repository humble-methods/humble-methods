  "content": "<h1>4 Pieces of Advice for My 20-Year-Old Kid to Avoid Being Broke at 35</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Find a Mentor, Not Just a Job</h2>\n<p>You learn from people, not from paychecks. Seek out mentors who can guide you and provide valuable insights into their experiences.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in Books, Not Degrees</h2>\n<p><strong>$75</strong> will buy you <em>The Simple Path to Wealth</em>, a book all about asset allocation and the psychology of money. It will teach you more about wealth than a quarter of a million dollar econ degree.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Learn to Market Yourself</h2>\n<p>No matter what you end up doing, learning how to market yourself is the number one skill you will ever develop, and it’s applicable to any goal you pursue.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Choose Your Friends Wisely</h2>\n<p>It’s true what they say: you wind up being the average of the five people with whom you spend the most time. Surround yourself with positive influences and ambitious individuals.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Start Investing Early</h2>\n<p>By investing just <strong>$3.47</strong> a day into a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>, you can become a tax-free millionaire by the age of <strong>65</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
