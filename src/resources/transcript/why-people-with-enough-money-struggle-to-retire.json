  "content": "<h1>Why People with More Than Enough Money Still Struggle to Retire</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Difficulty Shifting Gears</h2>\n<p>After decades of saving, many retirees struggle to shift gears. They physically can't spend without guilt, and it feels irresponsible even when the math says they’re fine.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Fear of the First Withdrawal</h2>\n<p>That first dollar spent feels like a cliff. But it’s not; it's a long, slow stroll downhill, and guess what? You packed a very nice picnic!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Ignoring Health’s Timeline</h2>\n<p>Many forget that health has a clock too. The best travel years are often in your <strong>60s</strong>. Don’t save every trip for your <strong>80s</strong> unless you’re really into cruise ship oxygen tanks! If that’s your thing, that’s awesome. You do you!</p>",
