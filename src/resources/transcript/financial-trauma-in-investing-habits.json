  "content": "<h1>How Financial Trauma Shows Up in Your Daily Investing Habits</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Panic Selling</h2>\n<p>If you panic sell every time the market drops <strong>5%</strong>, that might not just be bad investing. It could indicate a nervous system that still remembers the real sting of real loss.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Hyper Savers Lack Discipline</h2>\n<p>Hyper savers often aren't disciplined; instead, they feel anxious, thinking, <em>Iâ€™ll feel safe when I hit this number</em>. But that becomes a moving target, constantly shifting.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Financial Strategy as a Defense Mechanism</h2>\n<p>Financial trauma can turn strategy into a defense mechanism. You're not planning; you're armoring up. Sometimes, the best financial decision isn't about rebalancing that portfolio; it's about unpacking why you're afraid in the first place.</p>",
