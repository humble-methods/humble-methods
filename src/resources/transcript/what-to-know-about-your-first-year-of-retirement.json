  "content": "<h1>What No One Tells You About Money in Your First Year of Retirement</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Freedom is Accompanied by Anxiety</h2>\n<p>You thought you'd feel free, but now you feel anxious. Why? Because your entire adult identity was tied to productivity, and now your calendar's empty.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Second Guessing Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>You’ll second guess every withdrawal after having saved for <strong>30 years</strong>. Spending your own money can feel downright illegal.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Focus on Repurposing, Not Just Returns</h2>\n<p>The first year isn’t about returns; it’s about <strong>repurposing</strong>. Find routines, meaning, and structure. Otherwise, retirement can become unemployment with hobbies. So don’t just plan to stop working; plan for what starts next.</p>",
