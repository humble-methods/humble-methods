  "content": "<h1>The 3 Things You Haven't Been Told About the 4% Rule in Retirement</h1>\n<p>Here are the three things that you have not been told about the <strong>4% rule</strong> in retirement, and you're going to want to hear this one. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help you navigate your finances.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Potential Portfolio Growth</h2>\n<p>In <strong>1998</strong>, three professors conducted what is now referred to as the <strong>Trinity Study</strong>, concluding that you would be fine, on average, withdrawing <strong>4%</strong> of your retirement portfolio annually over <strong>30 years</strong>. But here\u2019s what you probably don\u2019t know: with a <strong>75-25</strong> stocks-bond split, after 30 years of withdrawing <strong>4%</strong> annually, not only would you be fine, you\u2019d have, on average, <strong>$10 million</strong> in your portfolio when you die.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Withdrawing More Than 4%</h2>\n<p>With that same <strong>75-25</strong> split, <strong>98%</strong> of the time, you would have been fine taking <strong>5%</strong> annually. <strong>96%</strong> of the time, you\u2019d be fine taking <strong>6%</strong>, and <strong>91%</strong> of the time, you\u2019d be fine taking <strong>7%</strong>. I'm not telling you to do it, but it's possible, so long as you keep your eye on the markets. If it tanks <strong>20%</strong> in a given year, maybe don\u2019t take <strong>7%</strong> that year.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Impact of Advisor Fees</h2>\n<p>With that same <strong>75-25</strong> split and a <strong>7%</strong> drawdown, if you\u2019re also paying a financial advisor <strong>1%</strong>, the odds of making it through retirement with money drop to <strong>69%</strong>. Add some mutual fund fees of <strong>1%</strong>, and you're looking at a <strong>50-50 coin flip</strong>. So hopefully that advisor would tell you: if you want the <strong>7%</strong>, you can't work with an advisor.</p>\n\n<p>And isn\u2019t it ironic, don\u2019t you think? A little too ironic.</p>",
