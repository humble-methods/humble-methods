  "content": "<h1>Unlocking Your Financial Future</h1>\n<p>Here's how big banks are making millions of dollars a year by convincing you that you can't do basic algebra. First, I want you to take <strong>110</strong> and now subtract your age. Got the number? Can you do that math? I thought so, but big banks have done a genius job of convincing you that you can't.</p>\n\n<h2>The Math Behind Retirement Funds</h2>\n<p>See, a target date retirement fund does nothing more than shift your money around once a year so that <strong>110 minus your age</strong> is how much typically is invested in equities, stocks, and the remainder is invested in fixed income, bonds.</p>\n\n<h2>Your Financial Empowerment</h2>\n<p>So if you can subtract your age from 110, and we've figured out that you can, and you can set aside <strong>10 to 15 minutes a year</strong> to move money from Fund X into Fund Y, then I do think it's worth asking why you're giving up tens of thousands of dollars towards your retirement dreams and putting it directly in the pockets of big corrupt banks who are treating you like a two-year-old who cannot do basic algebra.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As always, this is not advice. It's just one dumb-dumb's take. But honestly, it's a pretty good take. I'm not gonna lie. It's a good take.</p>",
