If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Guilt Around Spending</h2>\n<p>A lifetime of scarcity can often build guilt around spending. Even when you've made it, you're not magically free from your lifelong money script. If you feel guilty now about spending, I got news for you: that's not changing regardless of how much you have.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Habits Don't Retire</h2>\n<p>Your habits don't magically retire when you do. If you want to change this type of money script, you need to work on it today. Otherwise, you'll end up like your grandparents who had millions of bucks but still put biscuits in their purses at all-you-can-eat buffets to get their money's worth.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Time vs. Money</h2>\n<p>Later in life, the question shifts from \"Do I have enough money?\" to \"Do I have enough time?\" Many of my <strong>40-year-old</strong> friends are already seeing that. I know I am. Time is the new asset, not money. If we're not using our money to buy back time, we're missing the point altogether.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
