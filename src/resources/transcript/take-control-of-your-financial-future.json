These are two relatively objective resources that are not trying to sell you anything. Pick out an index fund or an ETF that matches your goals, needs, and desires.</li>\n<li><strong>Invest Regularly</strong>: Now, invest that $3.47 of spare change a day into that low-cost index fund or ETF. Remember that because you're doing this through a Roth IRA, any and all capital gains over the next 40 to 50 years of your life will be 100% tax-free, as long as you use it after 59 1/2.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And yeah, you're going to be 59 1/2 very soon. If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
