  "content": "<h1>Why 80% of People Plan to Fire Their Parents' Financial Advisors</h1>\n<p>Here's exactly why roughly 80% of people are planning on firing their parents' financial advisors when they inherit the money. It's not about rebellion; that was the piercings and the bad tattoos. The problem is far more simple: the old model is broken.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Communication Gap</h2>\n<p>They don't speak your language. Most advisors are stuck in retirement talk, operating from a <strong>1980s playbook</strong>. You need a partner who understands your modern financial life and speaks to your goals.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Narrow Focus</h2>\n<p>The scope is too narrow. Old school advice often stops at investments, ignoring crucial parts of your life, like <strong>tax strategy</strong>, <strong>estate planning</strong>, and <strong>debt management</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Conflicts of Interest</h2>\n<p>Traditional fees represent a conflict of interest. When an advisor charges you a <strong>percentage of your assets</strong>, their fee gets bigger just because your money grows, not because they do more work. And even worse, commissions simply mean they're selling you a product so they can get paid.</p>\n\n<h2>4. The Facet Solution</h2>\n<p>That's why I like what <strong>Facet</strong> is doing, giving you access to a dedicated team of CFP professionals who will help you with everything from financial planning to estate planning, from investment management to tax strategy, all for one flat membership fee.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So go to <a href=\"https://facet.com/tyler\" target=\"_blank\">facet.com/tyler</a> and answer a few simple questions to see if a Facet membership makes sense for you. And know this: it's okay to break up with your parent's advisor. They'll get over it eventually.</p>",
