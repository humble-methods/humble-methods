  "content": "<h1>Understanding Legal Tax Strategies for Investment Properties</h1>\n<p>Could you tell me something that seems illegal but isn't? Absolutely!</p>\n\n<p>Ten years ago, I bought an investment property in Nebraska. Then I upgraded to a property in Vermont. Then to a property in Pebble Beach, California. Finally, to our new property in Aspen. All without paying one dime in capital gains taxes to the IRS.</p>\n\n<p>Is this just some tax loophole that you only know about because you're rich? Nope! Anyone can take advantage of <strong>Section 1031</strong>. Just have to identify a new investment property within <strong>45 days</strong> of selling the old one, and close on that property within <strong>180 days</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If somebody else holds the proceeds from the sale, the IRS knows that they're going towards the new property.</p>\n\n<p>Where did you learn about this? I just follow <strong>Social Cap</strong>. They make complex finance seem easy.</p>",
