I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help you save money.</p>\n\n<h2>Investing in the Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Let's say you put <strong>$500</strong> today in a Roth IRA, followed by <strong>$500 a month</strong> for the next <strong>30 years</strong>, investing in a low-cost index fund. With an anticipated <strong>7% return</strong>, you will most likely have <strong>$570,570</strong> waiting for you in 30 years. </p>\n\n<h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>\n<p>Number two, this is where most of you might think, \"It's not that special; you already paid taxes on that money back when you put it in.\" But here is where most people are mistaken.</p>\n\n<h2>The Tax Benefits</h2>\n<p>You paid taxes on <strong>$180,500</strong> of contribution, and because you were savvy enough to invest in a Roth IRA, you not only increased your net worth by <strong>$390,000</strong> by doing essentially nothing, but that money\u2014<strong>$390,070</strong> of created wealth\u2014is <strong>100% tax-free</strong> after age <strong>59 1/2</strong>. You have never paid taxes on it, and you never will.</p>",
