  "content": "<h1>How to Become a Millionaire on a $75,000 Salary</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how I would become a millionaire on a <strong>$75,000</strong> a year salary. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help you reach your financial goals.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Save 20% of Each Paycheck</h2>\n<p>I would start by saving <strong>20%</strong> of each paycheck. Before we do anything else, we need to learn to live on less, and the earlier you start, the better.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in Both Tax Accounts</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>10%</strong> in a post-tax account like a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>, and <strong>10%</strong> in a pre-tax account like a <strong>traditional 401(k)</strong>. It doesn\u2019t matter what tax bracket you\u2019re in or what tax bracket you end up in; now you officially have both bases covered.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Market Yourself or Your Business</h2>\n<p>Yes, this part is advice: start marketing yourself or your business on social media today. Here\u2019s the deal: tag me in your first video, and I\u2019ll provide as much feedback as I can for free.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Commit to Your Plan</h2>\n<p>By committing to those three things, I promise that five years from now, you will be in a completely different space, doling out the exact same advice to others.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
