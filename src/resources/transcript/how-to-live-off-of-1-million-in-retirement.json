  "content": "<h1>How to Live Off of $1 Million in Retirement Without Worry</h1>\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in a Blue Chip Dividend Fund</h2>\n<p>I’d start by investing <strong>100%</strong> of my money in a blue chip dividend fund like <strong>Schwab's SCHD</strong>. This fund tracks some of the world’s most stable and enduring companies like <strong>Chemron</strong>, <strong>Cisco</strong>, and <strong>Home Depot</strong>, paying me about <strong>$35,000</strong> a year in dividends alone.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Draw from the Fund</h2>\n<p>Next, I would sell about <strong>0.5%</strong> of that fund per month, drawing an additional <strong>$60,000</strong> per year. I wouldn’t sell it all at once because <strong>75%</strong> of the time, the market is higher in a year than it is today.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Incorporate Social Security</h2>\n<p>Finally, I would take the national average of <strong>$24,000</strong> a year in Social Security, which gives me a total of just over <strong>$100,000</strong> a year in post-tax income.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Ensuring Longevity of Funds</h2>\n<p>Because I invested <strong>100%</strong> in stocks, according to the <strong>Trinity study</strong>, I’d still have over a <strong>96%</strong> chance of never running out of money, regardless of market conditions.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
