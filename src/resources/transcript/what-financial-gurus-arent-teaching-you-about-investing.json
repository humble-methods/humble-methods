  "content": "<h1>What Financial Gurus Aren't Teaching You About Investing</h1>\n<p>Here is what the financial gurus on social media are not teaching you about investing.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Low-Cost Index Funds</h2>\n<p>They're telling you to invest in low-cost index funds. Okay, that's a good start.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Direct Indexing</h2>\n<p>But they're not talking about <strong>direct indexing</strong> and the serious tax-saving potential it unlocks. We're talking hundreds, maybe even thousands back in your pocket.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Owning Individual Stocks</h2>\n<p>They're not telling you that instead of just buying an individual fund that mirrors the S&P 500, you could actually own hundreds of individual stocks that make up the S&P 500 and sell the stocks that lose value to lock in those losses on paper.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Offsetting Gains with Losses</h2>\n<p>When you lock in these losses on paper, you can use them to offset some or all of the profits if you sell other investments for a gain.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Avoiding Taxes on Capital Gains</h2>\n<p>This means you do not have to pay taxes on some of those capital gains.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Offsetting Concentrated Risk</h2>\n<p>They're definitely not telling you that you could use this exact same strategy to offset <strong>concentrated risk</strong>. If you're holding a ton of your company's stock and you want to diversify before your company goes out of business and is worth nothingâ€”just saying, it happens.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The upside of direct indexing is huge, but doing it yourself? Total headache. So go to <strong>facet.com/tyler</strong> today and let their team build and manage a strategy that fits you so you can get back to doing literally anything else.</p>",
