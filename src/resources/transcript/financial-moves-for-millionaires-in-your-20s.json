  "content": "<h1>Three Essential Financial Moves for Achieving Millionaire Status by Your 50s</h1>\n<p>If you're in your 20s, here are the only 3 financial moves you need to make to be a millionaire by your 50s. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, now creating free financial content to help you save money.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in the S&P 500</h2>\n<p>Invest at least $500 a month in the S&P 500. Historically, the market returns between 7% and 10%. If you start investing at 25 and do this consistently, you'll have over a million bucks by the time you're 55.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Avoid Financing Unnecessary Expenses</h2>\n<p>Don't finance dumb stuff like car loans, credit card debt, or buy-now-pay-later traps. For example, that $600 a month car payment could cost you $1.4 million by 55. It turns out that car was more expensive than it seemed.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Save a Portion of Your Raises</h2>\n<p>When you get a raise at work, put 50% of that raise immediately into your investments. By doing this, instead of just $1.1 million or $1.4 million, you're looking at well over $2 million by 55. This way, you can buy yourself whatever car you want with the interest from your investments alone.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow my content, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to financial stability!</p>",
