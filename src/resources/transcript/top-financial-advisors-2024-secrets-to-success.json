  "content": "<h1>Secrets to Success from the Top Financial Advisors of 2024</h1>\n<p>CNBC just published their list of <strong>top financial advisors for 2024</strong>, and here is exactly what the number one firm in America had to say is their secret to success.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Investment Group</strong>, CNBC's number one pick overall, said that their big secret to success, the reason they're number one, is that, and I quote, they do not engage in market timing, stock picking, or tactical allocation on any level. They do not react to market movements or economic news.</p>\n<p>Translation, you would do just as well as the top financial advising firm in the US if you went out today, bought a low-cost index fund that tracks the broad US market like Vanguard's VTSAX, held it forever, and never turned on the news again. If only we had figured this out sooner.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, <strong>like and follow</strong>, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
