Buy a $700,000 Duplex</h2>\n<p>Because my barber, <strong>Silas</strong>, said it was a tax haven.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in Meme Coins or NFTs</h2>\n<p>I've been advised to invest <strong>$100,000</strong> in meme coins or NFTs because my cousin, <strong>Lenny</strong>, insisted that <strong>Donkey Coin</strong> is different.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Hire an Investment Advisor</h2>\n<p>Paying <strong>1%</strong> of my assets to <strong>Dex Callahan</strong> so he can pretend to beat the stock market and call me annually to ask how my kids are doing. I don't even have kids.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Buy a Whole Life Policy</h2>\n<p>Paying <strong>Cole Vickers</strong>, an insurance agent, for a whole life policy or an IUL, even though I only need life insurance to cover my dependents until they no longer depend on me, a.k.a. <strong>term life</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Following the Crowd</h2>\n<p>Pretending I get an investment just because the world's doing the same. It's okay to say, <strong>I don't know.</strong> It's even more okay to say, <strong>and for those reasons, I'm out.</strong></p>",
