  "content": "<h1>Top Three Financial Accounts to Open in Your 30s or 40s</h1>\n\n<p>Hi, I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. High Yield Savings Account</h2>\n<p>I would fund this account with about $500 a month until it could cover three to six months of living expenses for me and my dogs. Those bloodhounds eat a lot! Currently, I can get about a 5% return for very little risk.</p>\n<p>This rate will not necessarily last, but as long as it does, you need a high yield savings account right now!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>I would fund this account with $583 a month to take advantage of my maximum annual contribution. I would invest that money in a low-cost index fund and let it grow for the next 30 years.</p>\n<p>Odds are, I\u2019d have about a million bucks waiting for me at retirement. Since it's funded with post-tax money, those gains are 100% tax-free. Additionally, I would actually use this as my second emergency fund. If I needed any of my contributions back before 59 1/2, I could take them back penalty and tax-free at any time, for any reason.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Taxable Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>I would put any additional disposable income that I could into this account, even starting with just $20 to $25 a week. This account would also be invested in low-cost index funds.</p>\n<p>This would serve as my five to 15-year goal account, and all capital gains would be taxed at about half the rate of my ordinary income.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, feel free to like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be!</p>",
