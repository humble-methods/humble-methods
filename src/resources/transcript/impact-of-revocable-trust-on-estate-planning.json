  "content": "<h1>How a Revocable Trust Impacts Estate Planning, Taxes, and Asset Protection</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Probate Avoidance</h2>\n<p>You've heard this one: assets in a revocable trust bypass probate. This allows for a more private and efficient transfer of wealth. Usually a good thing, it typically saves time and money.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Flexibility and Control</h2>\n<p>You retain control over the assets and can modify or revoke the trust at any time. Just in case you realize you didn't like your kids as much as you were told you were supposed to!</p>\n\n<h2>3. Limited Asset Protection</h2>\n<p>Unlike an irrevocable trust, since you maintain control and ownership, assets are generally considered available for creditors and are countable for Medicaid eligibility. If that's not your thing, see my other video on irrevocable trusts.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each Sunday morning, I'll send you over more thoughts like this!</p>",
