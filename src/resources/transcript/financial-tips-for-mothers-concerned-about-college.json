  "content": "<h1>3 Essential Steps for Mothers Worried About College Costs</h1>\n<p>If you are a mother concerned about affording college for your child, here are three things you need to do right now:</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a 529 College Savings Plan</h2>\n<p>Start by opening a <strong>529 college savings plan</strong>. You can fund this account with <strong>$16,000</strong> a year per spouse. If you have the means to do so, you can also take advantage of a one-time super fund option and contribute <strong>$80,000</strong> per spouse in the first year. If you do this when your child is born, they\u2019ll be set for college.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Plan for Unused Funds</h2>\n<p>If your child ultimately decides they don\u2019t want to attend college or they don\u2019t spend all that money on tuition, they can now transfer up to <strong>$35,000</strong> of those funds into a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. Many of my clients hesitated to invest in 529s because of their limitations, but this option alleviates that concern altogether.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Encourage Scholarship Searches</h2>\n<p>Ask and even beg your child to track down scholarships or grants to help pay for their education. These opportunities are often plentiful; they simply require some digging. And you know, deep down, that your child is the brightest in the room\u2014so let them leverage that intellect to find a scholarship or grant that will cover their college costs. Otherwise, they might end up 45 years old with kids, still trying to pay off a sociology degree.</p>\n\n<p>Taking these steps can help ease the financial burden of college. Remember, proactive planning today sets the foundation for your child's educational future!</p>",
