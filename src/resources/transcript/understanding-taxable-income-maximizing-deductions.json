  "content": "<p>Tyler? Yep. Looks like you had <strong>$100,000</strong> in income this year. You owe us <strong>$17,832</strong> in tax-</p> \n<p>Oh, no. Maxed out my <strong>401k</strong> with <strong>$20,500</strong>. My <strong>HSA</strong> was <strong>$7,300</strong>. My <strong>traditional IRA</strong> with another <strong>$6,000</strong>. <strong>$14,000</strong> of that was from renting out my house for two weeks. <strong>$50,000</strong> of that was capital gains from the sale of our home. Really? Yep.</p> \n<p>Oh, so only <strong>$3,500</strong> of taxable income? Oh. Actually donated that to a <strong>501c3</strong> non-profit. So, <strong>zero taxable income</strong>? That sounds about right.</p>",
