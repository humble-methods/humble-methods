  "content": "<h1>Why Traditional Finance Advice on Bonds is Flat Out Wrong</h1>\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Sequence of Returns Risk</h2>\n<p>Ever heard that you should invest more heavily in bonds as you get older? This advice was meant to protect you against <strong>sequence of returns risk</strong>. The idea is that if your portfolio takes a major hit in its first years of retirement, you’d be screwed for the next <strong>20 years</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. The Real Downside of Bonds</h2>\n<p>What nobody tells you is that once you’re through those first years, that bond allocation ain’t gonna cut it. Inflation, taxes, and interest rate risk make it the equivalent of your senior citizen piggy bank. And we all know how much that bought you!</p>\n\n<h2>3. A Better Strategy</h2>\n<p>I would flip this advice on its head. If you want to be <strong>70/30</strong> at retirement, fine—make a <strong>20-year plan</strong> to move towards <strong>90/10</strong>. This way, your portfolio's growth keeps up with your life. It’s not gambling; it’s simply relying on the one thing Wall Street has done right over the last <strong>100 years</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
