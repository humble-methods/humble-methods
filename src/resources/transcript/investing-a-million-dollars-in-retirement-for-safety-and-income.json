  "content": "<h1>Investing a Million Bucks in Retirement for Safety and Income Generation</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out this week's episode of the podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio. I go over this and other strategies in far greater detail.</p>\n\n<h2>1. $350,000 in a Bond Ladder</h2>\n<p>Start with a bond ladder from one to five years for <strong>steady income</strong>, <strong>capital safety</strong>, and to minimize interest rate risk.</p>\n\n<h2>2. $200,000 in a Fixed Index Annuity</h2>\n<p>No, I don't sell them, and no, they're not as awful as some people say. They are particularly useful if you want zero market downside, acting as the equivalent of a DIY pension.</p>\n\n<h2>3. $150,000 in Blue Chip Dividend Stocks</h2>\n<p>For these companies, <strong>boring is better</strong>. Think Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and Coca-Cola. They pay steady dividends and tend to hold up better than growth stocks in market downturns.</p>\n\n<h2>4. $100,000 in Preferred Stocks or REITs</h2>\n<p>Preferred stocks provide fixed income, while REITs offer monthly cash flow with the bonus of being a partial inflation hedge, making them a great physical asset for diversification.</p>\n\n<h2>5. $100,000 in Cash or Cash Equivalents</h2>\n<p>This serves as your <strong>peace of mind fund</strong>. Keeping one year in cash on the sidelines is always helpful if you're prioritizing safety.</p>\n\n<h2>6. $100,000 in TIPS</h2>\n<p>Invest in <strong>Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS)</strong>. These are government bonds that automatically adjust for inflation.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This portfolio's goal is to achieve <strong>3.5% to 4.5%</strong> income per year with minimal drawdowns and zero sleepless nights. Again, if any of this is helpful, tune into the podcast as I'll go over this in more detail.</p>",
