  "content": "<h1>3 Steps for Mothers to Help Their Children Become Millionaires</h1>\n<p>If you are a mother and you want your child to be a millionaire before you, then you need to do the following three things right now.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Hire Your Child</h2>\n<p>Hire your child to work for you and pay them <strong>$12,000</strong> a year to do so. There is no minimum age to earn a salary, as long as the job is not hazardous and is age-appropriate. For example, no, you cannot hire your <strong>five-year-old</strong> child to be your driver. Oh, and you can deduct that <strong>$12,000</strong> as a <strong>business expense</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Contribute to a Custodial Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Put <strong>$6,500</strong> of that money directly into a <strong>custodial Roth IRA</strong>. Invest in <strong>low-cost index funds</strong>, teach your child a thing or two about investing along the way, and they will most likely be a millionaire by age <strong>45</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Authorized User on Credit Card</h2>\n<p>Finally, list them as an <strong>authorized user</strong> on your credit card, but only if you have good credit yourself. They will inherit a stronger credit score at <strong>18</strong> and hopefully learn about responsible credit card use in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Taking these steps can set your child on the path to financial independence and wealth from an early age!</p>",
