  "content": "<h1>The Only Retirement Video You'll Ever Need</h1>\n<p>Here is the only retirement video you will ever need. And if I were you, I'd grab a pen and paper.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Track High Spending Month</h2>\n<p>Write down what you spend in a high spending month.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Track Low Spending Month</h2>\n<p>Now write down what you spend in a low month.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Average the Two</h2>\n<p>Average the two amounts together.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Annual Spending Projection</h2>\n<p>Multiply the average by 12 and that gives you your projected annual spending.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Adjust for Taxes and Life Events</h2>\n<p>Now multiply that number by 1.2 for taxes and random life events.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Determine Your Target Nest Egg</h2>\n<p>Next, multiply that by 20. That’s your target nest egg, as you can usually draw down 5% of your assets per year.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Sum Your Investable Assets</h2>\n<p>Now add up all your current investable assets.</p>\n\n<h2>8. Calculate Your Gap</h2>\n<p>Subtract the amount from step 7 from the amount in step 6. That’s your gap.</p>\n\n<h2>9. Pick Your Retirement Age</h2>\n<p>Choose your desired retirement age.</p>\n\n<h2>10. Years to Go</h2>\n<p>Calculate the years to go: your retirement age minus your current age.</p>\n\n<h2>11. Annual Savings Goal</h2>\n<p>Finally, divide the asset gap by the years to go. That’s what you need to save and invest each year across a taxable brokerage, a 401(k), or a Roth IRA.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
