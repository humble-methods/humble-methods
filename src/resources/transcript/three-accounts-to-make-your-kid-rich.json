  "content": "<h1>Three Accounts You Need to Make Your Kid Wildly Rich</h1>\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Custodial Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Start with a <strong>custodial Roth IRA</strong>. Contributing <strong>$7,000</strong> a year starting at age 10 could turn into about <strong>$3 million</strong> by age 60. Yes, you can pay them for modeling in your business on Instagram, shredding paper, or being promoted to <strong>chief dog petter</strong>. Just make sure to check with your CPA on that last one!</p>\n\n<h2>2. 529 Plan</h2>\n<p>Next, invest in a <strong>529 plan</strong>. You can fund that account with up to <strong>$190,000</strong> tax-free in year one if you’re married. This could give your child the ability to graduate college debt-free.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Custodial Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>If your kid’s a lazy bum and won’t shred paper for a few thousand bucks a summer, open a <strong>custodial brokerage account</strong>. You can put in any amount for any reason and invest it however you want. Even <strong>$200</strong> a month from birth could grow to <strong>$80,000</strong> by the time they graduate from high school. However, at age 18, the money’s theirs. Unfortunately, they could blow it all on a shiny depreciating asset, like a new car, and undo 18 years of your hard work in a single afternoon.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, tune into this week's episode of the podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio. I’ll go over this in way more detail.</p>",
