  "content": "<h1>Top Five Books That Taught Me More Than My MBA</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. <em>The Psychology of Money</em> by Morgan Housel</h2>\n<p>This book explains why your brain is often your biggest expense. It's about mastering behavior, not markets. And when you can do that, you win.</p>\n\n<h2>2. <em>All About Asset Allocation</em> by Richard Ferri</h2>\n<p>Considering over 90% of a portfolio's ultimate variation comes from asset allocation rather than picking stocks or timing the market. This manual is essential for building a real portfolio, offering actual strategy that works.</p>\n\n<h2>3. <em>Shoe Dog</em> by Phil Knight</h2>\n<p>The memoir of Nike's founder. It's not just about money; it's about risk, resilience, and why the line between genius and insanity is usually drawn in sweat. The best advice? Never stop. So many of us quit when we don't see immediate results.</p>\n\n<h2>4. <em>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</em> by Burton Malkiel</h2>\n<p>This book was the original reason I stopped pretending I could beat the market. I decided to join it instead and focus on better things, like dressing my bloodhounds up as Ben and Jerry for Halloween.</p>\n\n<h2>5. <em>Irrational Loyalty</em> by Deb Gabor</h2>\n<p>A masterpiece in brand building. Whether you're selling a product, an idea, or yourself, people buy connection long before they buy logic.</p>\n\n<p>All five together cost about a hundred bucks. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
