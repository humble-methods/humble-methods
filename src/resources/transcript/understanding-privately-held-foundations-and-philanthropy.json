Is this just some secret of the rich?</p>\n<p><strong>Oh, anybody can take advantage of section 4942 of the US tax code.</strong> Just create a private family foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>What's the catch?</strong> I just have to pay out 5% of the foundation's market value each year to a qualified charity.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens with the other 95%?</strong> That stays in the foundation and grows for future giving.</p>\n<p><strong>I like it. Great, because you're also hired to run the foundation.</strong> Oh, and I'm giving you the foundation when I die. Keeping it in the family. That's philanthropy, son.</p>",
