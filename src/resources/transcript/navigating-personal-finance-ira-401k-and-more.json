Or I might contribute <strong>$6,000</strong> to my Roth IRA and you can touch it now, but you can't touch it later.</p> <p>Ooh, or I might start my own small business and not let you touch <strong>$14,000</strong> now or <strong>$15,000</strong> now. Or I might max out my 401(k) or my 403(b) and not let you touch <strong>$20,500</strong>.</p> <p>I might contribute to my HSA, <strong>$300</strong>. Or my FSA, <strong>$2,850</strong>. Or I might do a combination of all of the above just to mess with you.</p> <p>Why would you want to mess with us? You really want me to answer that? No, I get it.</p>",
