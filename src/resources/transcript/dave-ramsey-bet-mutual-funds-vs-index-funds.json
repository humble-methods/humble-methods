  "subtitle": "Join the debate on whether actively managed mutual funds can outperform low-cost index funds in a high-stakes $100,000 bet starting June 2025.",
  "content": "<p>Because it\u2019s fairly easy to study mutual funds and pick them that outperform. Well, Dave, I officially challenge you to a <strong>$100,000 bet</strong>. Starting on June 1st, 2025, you will invest in nothing but the actively managed funds that you promote on your show. That, according to you, have beaten the market by 2%.</p> <p>I, in turn, will invest in nothing but <strong>passively managed low-cost index funds and ETFs</strong>. In five years, whoever has more money wins it all. And if researching mutual funds that outperform index funds is as easy as you say it is, this should be a no-brainer and an easy $100,000 for you.</p> <p>But remember, Dave, smarter people than you and me have made this bet before. It didn\u2019t turn out too well for your side.</p> <p>Let\u2019s all make sure that Dave Ramsey sees this and either publicly accepts or rejects an easy $100,000.</p>",
