Underestimating Health Care Costs</h2>\n<p>I see you! Medicare isn’t free, and private insurance at <strong>62</strong> can be a horror show only rivaled by used car dealerships.</p>\n\n<h2>2. No Plan for Their Time</h2>\n<p>They had no plan for their time. It turns out you can only play so much golf before you start missing all-hands meetings. I promise that’s going to happen. Retirement isn’t just about leaving work; it’s about replacing purpose.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Waiting Too Long to Practice Spending</h2>\n<p>Many retirees didn't practice spending soon enough. We're rewarded and applauded for saving for decades, which teaches frugality. But spending requires a whole new muscle. Many retirees are rich on paper but emotionally broke.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, check out the new podcast where we’ll explore this in more depth.</p>",
