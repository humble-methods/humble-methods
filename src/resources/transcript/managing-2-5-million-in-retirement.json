  "content": "<h1>How to Manage $2.5 Million in Retirement for Lasting Wealth</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in Low-Cost ETFs</h2>\n<p>I would start by investing <strong>$1.8 million</strong> in a low-cost ETF that tracks the S&P 500, like <strong>Vanguard's VOO</strong>. Not only would I now own a piece of some of the world’s most profitable and stable companies, but I would also collect about <strong>$20,000 a year</strong> in dividends alone from the fund.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Allocate to Blue Chip Dividend Funds</h2>\n<p>Then I would invest <strong>$500,000</strong> in a blue-chip dividend fund like <strong>Schwab's SCHD</strong> or <strong>Vanguard's VIG</strong>. This will slightly stabilize my portfolio by investing in more mature companies that have stood the test of time and continue to pay out dividends, which means another <strong>$20,000</strong> from dividends alone.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Maintain Liquidity with Money Market Funds</h2>\n<p>Next, I would invest the remaining <strong>$200,000</strong> (just under 10% of my portfolio) in a short-term money market fund like <strong>S-Gov</strong> for volatility mitigation and liquidity in down markets.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Strategic Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>However, I don’t want to live off of <strong>$40,000</strong> a year net taxes. So on the second day of each month, I’d sell <strong>0.5%</strong> of the VOO, netting another <strong>$90K</strong> or so post-tax. By drawing down only <strong>6%</strong> per year, and knowing the market on average historically returns <strong>7%</strong>, I’d have my cake while my portfolio eats it too.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Enjoying Retirement</h2>\n<p>Finally, I’d complement that <strong>$130,000</strong> a year with a national average of <strong>$24,000</strong> a year in Social Security, allowing me to live in Vermont on <strong>$150,000</strong> a year—buying flannel in bulk, heating my house with pure maple syrup fumes, and entering my bloodhounds in every small-town Halloween parade dressed up as Ben and Jerry.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my <strong>free weekly newsletter</strong> by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
