I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free so you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Spend It</h2>\n<p>You could spend it. Congrats, you just purchased <strong>$100</strong> worth of goods, services, or experiences. Hope it was awesome!</p>\n\n<h2>2. Save It in a Traditional Bank Account</h2>\n<p>You could save it in a <strong>traditional bank account</strong>, which would lose about <strong>2% to 3%</strong> of its purchasing power per year. Wake up in <strong>20 years</strong> and find that your $100 is worth only about <strong>$70</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in a Low-Cost Index Fund</h2>\n<p>Or you could invest it in a <strong>low-cost index fund</strong>. By taking advantage of long-term compound growth, you could wake up in <strong>20 years</strong> to find it worth closer to <strong>$386</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Your money, your choice. But for me, I choose option three.</p>\n<p>If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
