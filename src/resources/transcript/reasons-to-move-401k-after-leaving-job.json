  "title": "3 Important Reasons to Move Your 401k After Leaving a Job",
  "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Here are the three reasons I would never leave my money invested in a 401k if I no longer worked for that company.</p>\n<p>Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Reason 1: Fees</h2>\n<p>There are fees just to be in a 401k. Some companies will pay for this when you're an employee but when you leave, you're on your own.</p>\n\n<h2>Reason 2: Limited Investment Options</h2>\n<p>Employers have to pay more money to give employees more investment options; though no surprise there, 401ks are usually pretty limited.</p>\n\n<h2>Reason 3: Avoiding Forgotten Funds</h2>\n<p>So I don't forget about it. According to the most recent study, there's currently about 1.65 trillion dollars of forgotten money in all the 401ks. So when you leave your first job with a 401k, set up a rollover IRA, and every time you leave a subsequent job with a 401k, take that 401k with you so you don't forget about it and become part of the 1.65 trillion dollars of lost money.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
