  "content": "<h1>How Married Couples in Their 30s or 40s Can Save for Retirement Without a Roth IRA</h1>\n<p>If you're a married couple in your 30s or 40s, and you make too much money to contribute to a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>, here's what you need to do. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in a Taxable Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Start by investing <strong>$2,000 a month</strong> in a taxable brokerage account. You just said you made too much for a Roth IRA; this means you can afford it.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Choose Your Investment</h2>\n<p>Now invest that money in a low-cost index fund or a target date retirement fund, or whatever works for you.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Long-Term Growth Projection</h2>\n<p>Keep this up, and in <strong>30 years</strong>, you'll be projected to have about <strong>$2.4 million</strong> in that account.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Safe Withdrawal Rate</h2>\n<p>In retirement, you can safely withdraw about <strong>5%</strong> of that money, roughly <strong>$126,000</strong> a year.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Tax Benefits</h2>\n<p>If you take the married filing joint deduction of <strong>$30,000</strong> a year, you can tell the government you only made <strong>$96,000</strong> of capital gains, which means you pay <strong>zero</strong> in taxes because you're in the <strong>0%</strong> tax bracket. Enjoy your life tax-free without having to worry about Roth contribution limits, withdrawal limitations, or conversion headaches.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>And again, if any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
