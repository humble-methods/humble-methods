  "content": "<h1>Why I'd Take Social Security at 62, Even If I Didn't Have To</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Break-Even Point</h2>\n<p>The break-even point for delaying benefits for me is <strong>81 years old</strong>, while the average life expectancy—if I make it to <strong>62</strong>—is <strong>84 years old</strong>. So, am I really optimizing for just three potential years of bingo and cribbage?</p>\n\n<h2>2. More Cash When You’re Mobile</h2>\n<p>Taking it early means more cash while I’m still mobile enough to enjoy it. I’d rather road trip at <strong>64</strong> than finally go to Paris at <strong>83</strong> with a knee brace, dentures, and an allergy to other people!</p>\n\n<h2>3. A Lifestyle Decision</h2>\n<p>You’re not just making a math decision; you’re making a lifestyle one. Taking it early gives you <strong>optionality</strong>, especially if you don’t want to draw down your other investments. Delay it if it fits your plan, but don’t overlook the value of living while the living is still good.</h2>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Make the choice that aligns with your life goals and maximizes your enjoyment of those years.</p>",
