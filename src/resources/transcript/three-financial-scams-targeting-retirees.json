The Call from Social Security</h2>\n<p>You may get a call saying your benefits have been suspended, and you need to verify your information. <strong>Hang up the phone</strong> and call back the Social Security Administration at <strong>800-772-1213</strong>. Ask for Deb; she'll tell you what's what.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Fake Investment Opportunities</h2>\n<p>I personally have hundreds of imitators targeting you, pretending to be me, claiming they have a great investment for you if you just send them <strong>$500</strong>. In this social media world, you never know who's behind that account. Always do your research before making any financial commitments!</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Grandparent Emergency Scam</h2>\n<p>This one just breaks my little heart. It's a fake call from a grandchild telling you they're in trouble. If someone ever calls you, tell them you'll call them back and then contact the right number for that person or agency. And, I guess, you should text your grandchild because kids these days donâ€™t really know how to talk on the phone anymore. Just listening to my crotchety old self!</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking on the link in my bio.</p>",
