  "content": "<h1>How to Live Off $1 Million in Retirement Without Running Out of Money</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how I would live off of <strong>$1 million</strong> in retirement without ever running out of money. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free so you don\u2019t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in a Blue Chip Dividend Fund</h2>\n<p>I would invest <strong>100%</strong> of my money in a <strong>blue chip dividend fund</strong> that pays out about <strong>3.5%</strong> in dividends each year. That gives me <strong>$35,000</strong> of pre-tax income.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Annual Stock Sales</h2>\n<p>On January 2nd of each year, I would sell an additional <strong>4%</strong> of my stocks. This would provide another <strong>$40,000</strong> of pre-tax income.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Social Security Benefits</h2>\n<p>When I take my <strong>Social Security benefits</strong> at <strong>62</strong>, I\u2019ll receive an additional <strong>$25,000</strong> a year pre-tax. This will not only offset the taxes from the first two income sources but will also allow me to live on a net of about <strong>$75,000</strong> a year.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Growth of Investments</h2>\n<p>Because I invested <strong>100%</strong> of my money in stocks and expect them to grow at the historical average of <strong>8%</strong>, even after selling <strong>4%</strong> per year, my initial <strong>$1 million</strong> should be worth closer to <strong>$3.49 million</strong> in <strong>16 years</strong>. This would allow me to either live off the <strong>3%</strong> dividend yield alone for the rest of my life or spend over <strong>$300,000</strong> a year until I die\u2014because now I can.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll continue sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
