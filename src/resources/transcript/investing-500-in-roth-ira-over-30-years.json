  "content": "<h1>How Investing $500 in Your Roth IRA Can Grow to $1.14 Million in 30 Years</h1>\n<p>If you were to invest $500 today in your Roth IRA and subsequently $500 a month for the next 30 years, investing that money into a low-cost index fund like Vanguard's VOO or Fidelity's FXAIX, you would most likely have <strong>$1.14 million</strong> waiting for you in the Roth IRA.</p>\n<p>In contrast, if you were to put that money into your bank account, you would accumulate only about <strong>$180,000</strong>. That's a remarkable difference of <strong>$1 million</strong>.</p>\n<p>The best part? Because it's a Roth IRA, you won't owe a single penny of that <strong>$1.14 million</strong> to the government in taxes. I don\u2019t know about you, but I like having my money work for me, not someone else.</p>",
