  "content": "<h2>Five Years Later</h2>\n<p>I'll bet I make way more money as a corporate lawyer than you do as a mechanic in Vermont. Maybe. Let's see how this one plays out.</p>\n<p><strong>My starting salary was $200,000 right out of law school.</strong> Moved to the financial district, bought some Armani suits, a Rolex, and a BMW. You know, to fit in with the in crowd. Awesome!</p>\n\n<p><strong>My starting salary was only $60,000.</strong> But I moved to where all my friends were in a pretty affordable neighborhood. I bought a used Toyota Camry that works pretty well, and a Timex.</p>\n\n<h2>Fifteen Years Later</h2>\n<p><strong>I make a million bucks a year now.</strong> Upgraded to a place on the Upper West Side, upgraded the car to a Range Rover, and upgraded my watch collection to a couple of Patek Philippe. Perhaps you've heard of them. It's just how we roll when we're rich.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wow!</strong> I've just gotten a small raise each year, but I do drive the same car, live in the same house, and I wear the same clothes. Every time I get a raise, I just put it right in my retirement fund. Ooh, and my Timex still works.</p>\n\n<h2>Thirty Years Later</h2>\n<p><strong>Oh man, all my friends are moving to Greenwich</strong> and throwing these elite parties, and they all have like ten pools and seven elevators. I don't know how I'm gonna keep up with all this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I still have the same house in Vermont.</strong> Fully paid off. I switched used cars once to another Toyota Camry, but guess whose Timex still works?</p>\n\n<p><strong>I think I just had one thing that you never had.</strong> Oh yeah? What's that? Enough?</p>",
