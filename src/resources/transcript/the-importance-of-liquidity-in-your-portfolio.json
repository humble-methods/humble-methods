  "content": "<h1>Why You Need Liquidity in Your Portfolio</h1>\n<p>Here’s exactly why you need liquidity in your portfolio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Dream Home Dilemma</h2>\n<p>That dream house you invested in during your 30s? It might feel like a financial prison in your 40s.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Challenges of Private Equity</h2>\n<p>Private equity might sound fun until you realize you can't access it until your knees give out. And even then, it's only for a one-hour window once a year. Oops, you missed it!</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Quick Changes in Life</h2>\n<p>Life changes quickly. Illiquid assets do not pivot; they trap you. I’m not saying not to invest in them, just limit it to what you don’t think you'll need for the next <strong>10 to 20 years</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
