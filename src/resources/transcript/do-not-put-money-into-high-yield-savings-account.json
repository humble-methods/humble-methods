  "content": "<h1>Three Crucial Things to Know Before Investing in a High-Yield Savings Account</h1>\n<p>Do not put money into a high-yield savings account until you know these three things. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Interest Rates Will Go Down</h2>\n<p>The Fed has just signaled that they're most likely going to cut rates as of this year once inflation is completely cooled. Bye-bye inflation, bye-bye 5% return on your high-yield savings account.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Bank Stability Concerns</h2>\n<p>Most of these banks have only been in existence for a couple of years, taking advantage of this high-interest rate environment. They have no history of stability, no consistent management, and little understanding of their own identity.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Alternative Investment Options</h2>\n<p>By putting money into a dividend fund instead, like Schwab's SCHD, you could get a relatively stable 3% to 4% return annually, while still owning the underlying assets. Unlike in your high-yield savings account, where all you own is depreciating cash.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
