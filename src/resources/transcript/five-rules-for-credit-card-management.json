  "content": "<h2>1. Prioritize Paying Off Credit Card Debt</h2><p>You have no business creating an emergency fund until your credit card debt is 100% paid off. Your credit card debt is your emergency. That debt is costing you <strong>20-30% in interest</strong>. An emergency fund, at best, offers a <strong>5% gain</strong> through a high yield savings account. Therefore, you are losing <strong>15-20%</strong> of your hard-earned money annually.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Use Your Credit Card Like a Debit Card</h2><p>The best thing you can ever do with a credit card is to use it like a debit card. Only buy what you can afford, pay it off immediately, and you'll start gaining <strong>2-3%</strong> on cash back or other rewards, rather than losing that 20-30%.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Avoid Purchasing What You Can't Afford</h2><p>The worst thing you can do is to use your credit card to finance purchases that you cannot afford. This behavior leads to accumulating debt due to being charged <strong>20-30%</strong> on loans, making it the quickest path to perpetual indebtedness.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Choose Your Credit Card Wisely</h2><p>The smartest strategy you can adopt is to take your time when selecting a credit card. Ensure its rewards program aligns with your preferences and needs. For instance, if you dislike flying, don\u2019t opt for a credit card that rewards high sky miles. Instead, if you enjoy driving, look for a card that offers great cash back at gas stations.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Focus on Maintaining a Good Credit Score</h2><p>Forget about chasing that <strong>800 credit score</strong>. As long as your score is above <strong>720</strong>, you will have access to the best rates and lines of credit. Achieve this by consistently paying off your credit card debt and keeping your credit utilization rate below <strong>30%</strong>. To calculate your utilization rate, compare the balance on your card to the spending limit; for example, with a <strong>$1,000 limit</strong>, keep your spending below <strong>$300</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow for more tips aiming to guide you closer to financial success.</p>",
