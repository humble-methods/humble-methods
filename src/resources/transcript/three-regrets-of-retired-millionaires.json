  "content": "<h1>3 Things Retired Millionaires Wish They Knew Sooner</h1>\n<p>Here are three things retired millionaires wish they knew sooner. If any of this is helpful, join the <strong>50,000</strong> other readers who are already getting smarter with their money by signing up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Millionaire Status is Not Enough</h2>\n<p>First, being a <strong>millionaire</strong> is often not enough these days. I hate to say it, but with inflation, taxes, healthcare, and longevity, what might have once felt like plenty in your <strong>50s</strong> can suddenly feel ridiculously tight in your <strong>70s</strong>. Instead of focusing on the number, concentrate on your <strong>annual cash flow</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Playing It Too Safe Too Soon</h2>\n<p>Second, many retirees, through no fault of their own, are taught to become more conservative as they age. This often leads to dumping stocks for <strong>bonds</strong>, but the truth is that low returns and inflation erode the purchasing power of those bond payouts. A <strong>30-year retirement</strong> requires a focus on growth—period.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Retirement as an End Game</h2>\n<p>Lastly, they spent their lives thinking of retirement as an end game. Retirement isn’t just about not working; it’s about not working on things you didn’t want to work on. Many retirees struggle with finding purpose because they no longer identify with their previous careers. The happiest retirees have a plan for their time.</p>\n\n<p>So stop wasting your life running away from something and start thinking daily about what you’re running towards.</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, go check out my podcast, where we dive deeper into these topics—it's more than just 60 seconds of insight!</p>",
