If any of this is helpful, check out my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Don’t Treat It Like a Bonus</h2>\n<p>Don’t treat the inheritance like a bonus or house money. Windfalls are emotional money. If you spend it fast, you might be trying to outrun the weight of where it came from.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Park It for 90 Days</h2>\n<p>Park it now for <strong>90 days</strong> before making any decisions. Whether in a high-yield savings account or short-term money markets, give yourself time to think, not to react.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Align the Funds</h2>\n<p>Use the money to stabilize your future—whether that's investing, paying down debt, or creating that emergency fund. In part, this action honors your past and might even be something your loved one would have smiled at.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Remember, it’s not just money; it’s a legacy. Slow down and be intentional, as it’s the best way to respect both.</p>",
