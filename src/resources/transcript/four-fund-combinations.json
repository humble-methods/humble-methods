  "content": "<h1>The Only Four Fund Combinations You Need for Investing</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. For Your 20s and 30s</h2>\n<p>Invest in one fund: <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/vug/overview\">VUG, Vanguard's Growth ETF</a>. This means 100% stocks, zero bonds. You have a 30 plus year time horizon; volatility does not matter.</p>\n\n<h2>2. For Your 40s and 50s</h2>\n<p>Use two funds: <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/vti/overview\">VTI, Vanguard Total Stock Market</a> and <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/bnd/overview\">BND, Vanguard's Total Bond Market</a>. We add bonds for stability because the closer you get to needing the money, the more you might need bonds. Think timeline, not age.</p>\n\n<h2>3. For Global Diversification</h2>\n<p>If you're worried the US won't dominate forever, use three funds: <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/vti/overview\">VTI</a> plus <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/vxus/overview\">VXUS, Vanguard's International Stock ETF</a> plus <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/bnd/overview\">BND</a>. This gives you global diversification without added complexity. An example allocation could be 70% VTI, 20% VXUS, and 10% BND - done!</p>\n\n<h2>4. For Added Sophistication</h2>\n<p>If you want more sophistication (which you don’t need), use four or five funds. This would include <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/vti/overview\">VTI</a> plus <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/bnd/overview\">BND</a> plus <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/vxus/overview\">VXUS</a> plus one or two of either <a href=\"https://www.investor.vanguard.com/etf/vnq/overview\">VNQ, Vanguard's Real Estate Trust Index</a>, <a href=\"https://www.spdrs.com/product/fund.do?name=GLD\">GLD</a>, or cryptocurrency like <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin\">BTC</a>. Keep this part under 10% combined. Most people do not need this added complexity, but if you want non-correlation and like to talk about your portfolio at dinner parties, this is your answer.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
