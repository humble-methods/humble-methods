  "content": "<h1>The Number One Reason You Won't Retire Early</h1> <p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now, I create financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p> <h2>Investing in Your Future</h2> <p>Let's dive into the numbers. If you fund a Roth IRA today with $500 and then contribute $500 a month for the next 30 years, you'll most likely have <strong>$570,570</strong> waiting for you in 30 years.</p> <h2>Addressing Inflation Concerns</h2> <p>You might be thinking, \"Well, that won't be worth anything in 30 years,\" but allow me to provide some context.</p> <h2>Historical Returns of the S&P 500</h2> <p>The S&amp;P 500 has returned over <strong>10%</strong> annually since 1957. In my calculations, I account for inflation by deducting <strong>3%</strong> per year using a conservative <strong>7%</strong> return rate. Therefore, that <strong>$570,570</strong> in 30 years will retain its purchasing power.</p> <h2>The Choice is Yours</h2> <p>So, while you may choose to say that inflation prevents you from investing, remember, you can always use <strong>7%</strong> instead of <strong>10%</strong>. The projected numbers will reflect the actual purchasing power of your money whenever you desire it.</p>",
