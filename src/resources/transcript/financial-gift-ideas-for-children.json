  "content": "<p>Hey dad, can you tell me what I'm getting for my 12th birthday? I'm giving you <strong>2.3 million dollars</strong>.</p> <p>Really? Well, not yet. Right now, I'm giving you a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>, and as long as you mow the lawn in the summer and shovel the driveway in the winter, I will put <strong>$6,000 a year</strong> into that account for you until you're 18.</p> <p>You can do that for him because it's classified as <strong>earned income</strong>. That will be <strong>$63,000</strong> for you by the time you're 18.</p> <p>Without your ever needing to invest another dollar, it will be <strong>$2.3 million</strong> for you by the time you're 65.</p> <p>Thanks dad! Hey, sure beats paying a <strong>quarter of a million dollars</strong> for an arts and science degree.</p>",
