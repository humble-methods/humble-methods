  "content": "<h1>Your Three-Step Playbook to Become the First Millionaire in Your Family</h1>\n<p>If you're in your 30s and want to be the first millionaire in your family, here's your three-step playbook. Don't say nobody ever told you how to make it happen.</p>\n\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I create financial content for free, so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Open a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> right now through <strong>Fidelity</strong>, <strong>Schwab</strong>, or <strong>Vanguard</strong>. It’s free and will take you about <strong>five minutes</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Automate Your Contributions</h2>\n<p>Now automate <strong>10%</strong> of your paycheck into the Roth. Don’t think about it; just set it and forget it.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in Low-Cost Index Funds</h2>\n<p>Once the money is inside the Roth, invest it in low-cost index funds like <strong>Vanguard's VOO</strong> or <strong>Fidelity's FXAIX</strong>. These funds represent hundreds of the world's biggest and most profitable companies, now working for you.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Projected Growth</h2>\n<p>If you max it out from age <strong>30</strong> to <strong>65</strong>, you’ll have about <strong>$1.7 million</strong> of tax-free money, and you only put in <strong>$245,000</strong>. The market built you another <strong>$1.4 million</strong>, all because you clicked <em>open account</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
