  "content": "<h1>The 3-Step No BS Plan for Financial Success in Your 20s</h1>\n<p>If I were in my 20s and wanted to figure out how to be rich and avoid being broke, here's my 3-Step No BS Plan.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial adviser and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 1: Assess Your Debt</h2>\n<p>Start by figuring out what debt you'll pay down versus what debt you'll let ride. How? By comparing the interest on the debt to the return on the 10-year US government bond, also known as the risk-free rate.</p>\n<p>If the interest on your debt is higher than the risk-free rate, pay down the debt. But if it's lower, let the debt ride and invest your money either in the risk-free asset class or in an S&P 500 fund.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 2: Maximize Your 401(k) Match</h2>\n<p>If your company offers a 401(k) match, do everything you can to contribute just enough to get that full matchâ€”this is free money! If you make $50,000 a year and your company offers a 5% match, understand that it can amount to a quarter of a million dollars from the company if invested over the long-term.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 3: Invest in a Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Once you hit the match for the 401(k), I would not max out the 401(k). Instead, invest any leftover money you can afford to invest into a Roth IRA. You'll likely be in a lower tax bracket and have more investing options than in the 401(k). Most importantly, you can withdraw your contributions at any time penalty and tax-free, unlike the 401(k).</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter in my bio. Every Sunday morning, I'll send over more insights on how to keep you from being broke.</p>",
