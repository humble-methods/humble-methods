  "content": "<h1>How to Live Off of $2 Million in Retirement Without Running Out of Money</h1>\n<p>Here’s exactly how I’d live off of <strong>$2 million</strong> in retirement without ever running out of money. And I warn you, it goes against everything you've ever been taught.</p>\n\n<p>I’m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free, so you don’t have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Investment Allocation</h2>\n<p>I’d invest <strong>90%</strong> in stocks through a total market fund like Vanguard's <strong>VTI</strong> and the remaining <strong>10%</strong> in money markets through a fund like Fidelity's <strong>SPAXX</strong>. It’s good enough for Buffett, it's good enough for me.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Forget the 4% Rule</h2>\n<p>I’d wave goodbye to the <strong>4% rule</strong> because that’s fear-based nonsense. An average million-dollar portfolio that only draws down <strong>4%</strong> annually while mostly invested in stocks ends up being worth close to <strong>$10 million</strong> after 30 years post-inflation.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Drawdown Strategy</h2>\n<p>Starting by drawing down <strong>6%</strong> per year would net me about <strong>$100,000</strong> annually between the VTI and SPAXX, just enough money to fund my Viore fall wardrobe.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Projected Growth</h2>\n<p>Doing the quick math, I appreciate that I’m still projected to die with about <strong>$2.6 million</strong>. After five years, I’d increase it to <strong>7%</strong> per year, taking closer to <strong>$175,000</strong> annually. This would allow me to get matching Filson vests for me and my bloodhounds. And if that’s not real wealth, I don’t know what is.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Maximum Drawdown</h2>\n<p>With that draw, I’m still projected to wind up with <strong>$2 million</strong> at death. Knowing I now only have about eight to ten years left, I’d ramp it up to a <strong>$200,000</strong> annual drawdown to fund my high-stakes bingo circuit.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Kick it into eternity with style. Bingo, baby! If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week I’ll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
