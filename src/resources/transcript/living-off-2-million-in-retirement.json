  "content": "<h1>How to Live Off $2 Million in Retirement Without Running Out of Money</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how I\u2019d live off of <strong>$2 million</strong> in retirement without ever running out of money. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help guide your retirement journey.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in a Total Stock Market Fund</h2>\n<p>I\u2019d start by investing <strong>100%</strong> of my money in a single total <strong>stock market fund</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Ditch the 4% Rule</h2>\n<p>I'd kiss the <strong>4% rule</strong> goodbye because it's an overly conservative myth.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Adjust My Withdrawal Rate</h2>\n<p>Then, I\u2019d draw down <strong>6%</strong> annually, averaging anywhere from <strong>$50,000</strong> to <strong>$100,000</strong> a year post-tax.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Combine with Social Security</h2>\n<p>Next, I\u2019d combine that with my <strong>Social Security benefits</strong> that I\u2019d take at <strong>62</strong> to add another <strong>$25,000</strong> post-tax.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Do the Math</h2>\n<p>Unlike those finance gurus following the 4% rule, I sit down and crunch the numbers myself.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Test My Strategy</h2>\n<p>And I'm not just calculating any numbers. I figured out if I could get away with this strategy if I retired at the beginning of <strong>2000</strong> and lived through the <strong>dot-com bubble</strong>, the <strong>subprime housing crisis</strong>, and <strong>COVID</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Results of the Strategy</h2>\n<p>Not only would I have managed to withdraw <strong>6%</strong> annually during this timeframe, but even after adjusting an additional <strong>2.5%</strong> per year for inflation, I would still have just under <strong>$1 million</strong> waiting for me in <strong>2025</strong>. And that\u2019s during the single worst sequence of returns events in modern history. Imagine what would have been left if you had retired during an average year as a regular person.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, please like and follow, and I'll keep sharing insights to help you achieve your financial goals.</p>",
