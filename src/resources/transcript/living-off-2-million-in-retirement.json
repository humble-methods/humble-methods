  "content": "<h1>Living Off of $2 Million in Retirement</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it. Here's how I'd manage a $2 million retirement portfolio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Investment Structure</h2>\n<p>I would start by allocating 80% into stocks via <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VTI\">VTI</a>, Vanguard's Total Stock Market ETF, and the remaining 20% in a money market fund like <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/money-market/fidelity-government-money-market-fund/fpxx\">Fidelity's SPAXX</a>. If it's a good enough plan for Buffett's estate, it's good enough for me.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Withdrawal Strategy</h2>\n<p>Initially, I would withdraw only about 4% to 5% in year one, equating to $80K. This conservative approach helps secure my financial stability, especially if the market experiences a downturn early in retirement.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Growth Expectations</h2>\n<p>Research indicates that the average retiree often dies with 80% of their savings intact. Most $2 million portfolios, withdrawing just 4%, may actually wind up close to $20 million after 30 years due to compounded growth.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Adjusting Withdrawals</h2>\n<p>After the first couple of years, once I've reassured myself about the sequence of returns risk, I would gradually increase my stock allocation to 90% and boost my withdrawals to 6% or 7%. This change would allow me to withdraw nearly $120K a year and spend on things that matter most to me.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Final Decade of Spending</h2>\n<p>If I'm still enjoying life after 10 years, I would increase my withdrawals to 7% to 10% per year, taking home around $180K to $200K annually. With those withdrawals, I could indulge in extended vacations or cruises surrounded by new friends, because accumulating wealth was never my ultimate goal.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio, and each week I'll send you over another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
