  "content": "<h1>Why Real Wealth Has Nothing to Do with Your Net Worth</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Net Worth vs. Optionality</h2>\n<p>Your net worth may look great on paper, but paper doesn’t pick your kid up from school. People love to brag about their net worth, but if you can’t say yes to a weekday hike or a dentist appointment before <strong>4 p.m.</strong>, you lack something far more important: <strong>optionality</strong>. This gives you the freedom to rearrange your life when life rearranges you.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Liquidity Over Luxury</h2>\n<p><strong>Liquidity</strong> beats luxury every single time. That Range Rover may look great until you realize you can’t leave your job because of the lease payment. Real wealth is the freedom to say, <em>onto the next</em>, not <em>I’m locked in and can’t leave</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Time is the Ultimate Flex</h2>\n<p>Would you rather have <strong>$5 million</strong> and no time, or <strong>$500,000</strong> with full control over every single one of your days? If you hesitated for even a second, congrats, you’re now thinking like a rich person.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Stop chasing net worth for bragging rights and start building the kind of life where you can actually say yes to the things that matter.</p>",
