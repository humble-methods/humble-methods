  "content": "<h1>5 Essential Accounts for Women in Their 20s to Achieve Financial Independence</h1>\n<p>If you're a woman in your 20s and you want to stop depending on that nine-to-five job so much, you need to make sure you have access to the following five types of accounts today.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Emergency Fund</h2>\n<p>First, establish an <strong>emergency fund</strong> with three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses. Right now, this could be in a <strong>high-yield savings account</strong> earning <strong>3% to 4%</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Investment or Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Second, open an <strong>investment or brokerage account</strong> through Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard. While this is a taxable account, using it to invest can typically help you keep pace with inflation.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Roth IRA</h2>\n<p>Third, set up a <strong>Roth IRA</strong>. This is a retirement account funded with post-tax dollars, and the advantage is that in 20 to 30 years, after compound growth, you won\u2019t have to pay capital gains tax on the withdrawals.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Pre-Tax Retirement Account</h2>\n<p>The fourth account should be a <strong>pre-tax 401(k)</strong> or a <strong>traditional IRA</strong>. These retirement accounts allow you to take some money off the table from the government this tax year, as you can deduct <strong>$22,500</strong> from a 401(k) and <strong>$6,500</strong> from an IRA.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Health Savings Account (HSA)</h2>\n<p>Finally, consider a <strong>Health Savings Account (HSA)</strong>. Contributions are tax-deductible, you can invest that money for growth, and as long as it\u2019s used for qualified medical expenses, distributions are tax-free. Plus, the funds roll over from one year to the next, allowing it to grow continuously.</p>\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t have these five accounts, you need to set them up today for a strong financial future!</p>",
