  "content": "<h1>The Key Difference Between Middle Class and Upper Class: Understanding Debt</h1>\n<p>Here is the number one thing that separates the middle class from the upper class. I\u2019m Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and I create financial content for free to help you understand your financial choices.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Middle Class Attitudes Toward Debt</h2>\n<p>The middle class has been taught to avoid <strong>debt at all costs</strong>. They focus on getting a job, paying off debt, and living paycheck to paycheck just to keep their heads above water.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Upper Class Understanding of Debt</h2>\n<p>In contrast, the upper class has been taught to understand the difference between <strong>good debt</strong> and <strong>bad debt</strong>. Good debt buys appreciating assets that generate cash flow or increase your net worth, such as <strong>real estate</strong>, <strong>stocks</strong>, and <strong>education</strong>. This kind of debt typically carries <strong>low interest rates</strong>, and that interest can be deductible if it\u2019s for education or for your mortgage.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Identifying Bad Debt</h2>\n<p>On the other hand, bad debt involves spending money on depreciating assets that do not generate cash flow or increase your net worth, such as <strong>credit card debt</strong>, <strong>auto loans</strong>, and <strong>consumer electronics</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So, next time you hear someone tell you to just stay out of debt, you might want to ask them what type of debt they\u2019re talking about. If any of this information is helpful, please like and follow, and I\u2019ll keep sharing insights to help you get one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
