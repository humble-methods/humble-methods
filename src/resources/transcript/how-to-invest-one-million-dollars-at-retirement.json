  "content": "<h1>How to Invest $1 Million at Retirement</h1>\n<p>Here is exactly how I would invest $1 million when I retire in order to maintain a healthy cash inflow while still preserving the money that I've worked so hard to make.</p>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Invest in Dividend Aristocrats</h2>\n<p>Number one, I would invest <strong>40 to 50%</strong> of that million dollars into the <em>dividend aristocrats</em>. These are large, financially sound and well-established companies that have consistently increased their dividends over the last <strong>25 years</strong>. I might invest in these through a fund like <strong>ProShares NOBL</strong> or <strong>Fidelity's KNGLX</strong>. This fund would give me broad exposure, it would reduce risk and still have the potential to appreciate over time.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Invest in High-Quality Bonds</h2>\n<p>Number two, I would invest <strong>30 to 40%</strong> of that million dollars into <em>high quality corporate or government bonds</em>. This would give me consistent cash flow, less volatility than stocks, and the corporate bonds would offer me a higher return than the government bonds while still being considered relatively safe.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)</h2>\n<p>And number three, I would invest the remaining <strong>10 to 20%</strong> in <em>real estate investment trusts</em> or REITs. This would give me long-term access to real estate exposure without having to become a landlord. It would provide me with consistent dividends that are usually higher than the aristocratic dividend stocks and it still could appreciate over time. It also provides me with additional diversification across asset classes.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
