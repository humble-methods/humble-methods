  "content": "<h1>Three Key Strategies to Boost Your Investment Portfolio</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I make financial content for free so you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Control Costs</h2>\n<p>Every dollar you pay in fees is a dollar that's not compounding for you. If you're paying <strong>1%</strong> in fees and the market returns <strong>10%</strong>, you're not getting <strong>9%</strong>, you're getting way less because of compounding. So buy low-cost funds like <strong>VOO</strong>, <strong>VTI</strong>, or <strong>SCHD</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Optimize Your Investment Location</h2>\n<p>Growth funds like <strong>QQQ</strong> or <strong>VUG</strong> belong in a Roth IRA because of tax-free growth forever. Whereas S&P 500 funds like <strong>VOO</strong> or <strong>SPY</strong> can be in a taxable brokerage account due to their efficiency. Dividend stocks or bond funds should be in a pre-tax IRA, 401(k), or Roth IRA, unless you need the income now. Placing a fund in the wrong account can cost you thousands over a lifetime.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest in the Funds That Work Best for You Right Now</h2>\n<p>In your 20s or 30s, that might be growth funds like <strong>QQQ</strong> and <strong>VUG</strong>. In your 40s and 50s, it might just be an S&P 500 fund. And in your 60s and 70s, that could be a combination of a total market fund, a dividend fund, and a bond fund. As always, do what works for you at the right time.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, sign up for my free weekly newsletter by clicking the link in my bio. Each week, I'll send you another money playbook that actually works.</p>",
