  "content": "<h1>How to Maximize Your Savings Earnings with Money Market Funds</h1>\n<p>If you wanna make over 55 times what you're currently making in your savings account, but you have no idea where to start, then you need to do the following three things right now.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Open a Brokerage Account</h2>\n<p>Open up a brokerage account with <strong>Fidelity</strong>, <strong>Schwab</strong>, or <strong>Vanguard</strong>; it doesn't matter which one. It will take you less than 10 minutes, and you never have to use it if you don't want to. Fund that account with <strong>$20 or $25 a month</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Research Money Market Funds</h2>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com\" target=\"_blank\">NerdWallet</a> and look up the following money market funds:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Vanguard's VMFXX</strong></li>\n    <li><strong>Schwab's SWVXX</strong></li>\n    <li><strong>PIMCO's AMAXX</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these funds is earning over <strong>5%</strong> on your money, which is more than 50 times what you're making in most of your savings accounts. Additionally, the money is invested in short-term, relatively safe securities.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Invest and Relax</h2>\n<p>Put that <strong>$20 to $25</strong> into one of those money market funds and then sit back, relax, and let <strong>compound interest</strong> and <strong>time</strong> take care of the rest. But as always, do your own research.</p>",
