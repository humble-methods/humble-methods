  "content": "<h1>How I'd Invest My First $1,000 as a Former Financial Advisor</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler, and if any of this is helpful, sign up for my free newsletter by clicking the link in my bio.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Skip the S&P 500 Index Fund</h2>\n<p>With my first <strong>$1,000</strong>, I would not invest in an index fund that tracked the S&P 500. This will teach you absolutely nothing and is a waste of your first <strong>$1,000</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Buy Individual Stocks</h2>\n<p>Instead, with my first <strong>$1,000</strong>, I would buy all individual stocks. Remember, this first <strong>$1,000</strong> is not your retirement plan; it's an <strong>investing education</strong>, and it's the cheapest tuition payment you'll ever make.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Track Your Responses</h2>\n<p>I would then track exactly how I respond to stocks that go up and how I respond to stocks that go down. I want you to learn what it's like to pretend you knew what you were doing and also what it's like to remember that you donâ€™t.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Embrace the Lesson</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, yep, I'm gonna say it. I want you to lose it all, so you will always remember you should have just invested in the S&P 500 and called it a day. This is a lesson, like most others, you will only learn by doing. An expensive lesson, cheaply learned.</p>",
