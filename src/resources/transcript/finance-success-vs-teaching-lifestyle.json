  "content": "<h1>A Comparison of Finance Success and the Teaching Lifestyle</h1>\n<p>I am going to make so much more money than you as a finance bro than you will as an English teacher up in Vermont. Probably. Let's see how our lives play out.</p>\n<h2>Five Years Later</h2>\n<p>I've already made vice president at my bank. I get insane bonuses and I'm already worth about five million dollars. How's teaching up in Vermont going for you?</p>\n<p>Great. Every day I wake up and go for a walk with the dogs in the woods as we're watching the sun come up. Then I head to school where I get to chat with students about ideas all day long. I head home around 3 p.m. I get to be with my family, eat dinner with them, and then sit by the fire and read for the night.</p>\n<h2>Twenty Years Later</h2>\n<p>I just made partner in the firm, pull in about two million dollars a year, and should be able to retire before 60. Congrats! What's your plan now that you're super rich and successful?</p>\n<p>Honestly, I'm thinking of moving to a small town in Vermont or Maine. Get a couple dogs, wake up in the morning, go for walks in the woods, go down to the local coffee shop to talk about ideas with locals, come back home and spend as much time as possible with my wife and kids.</p>\n<p>Sounds great, but didn't your kids all move to the West Coast already with families of their own?</p>\n<p>But I'm just telling you what my ideal vision for the future is now that I'm as rich as I am and I can afford just about anything I want. Hmm, I guess that does sound pretty ideal.</p>",
