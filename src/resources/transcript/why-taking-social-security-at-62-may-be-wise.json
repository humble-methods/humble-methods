  "content": "<h1>3 Reasons Why Locking in Social Security at 62 Could Be Your Safest Move</h1>\n<p>Here are three reasons why locking in Social Security at <strong>62</strong> might be the safest financial move you'll ever make. I'm Tyler, a former financial advisor and portfolio manager, and now I create financial content for free to help guide you in your decision-making.</p>\n\n<h2>1. The Trust Fund is Running Dry</h2>\n<p>The old trust fund is projected to run dry by <strong>2034</strong> or sooner if economic conditions worsen. Once that happens, benefits could automatically be cut by <strong>20-25%</strong>, unless Congress takes action. And we all know how efficient Congress is at fixing things.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Unfavorable Political Climate</h2>\n<p>The political climate is not in your favor. Social Security's financial hole is trillions of dollars deep, and the only ways to fix it are to <strong>raise taxes</strong> (you hate that), <strong>cut benefits</strong> (you hate that even more), or <strong>raise the retirement age</strong> beyond <strong>67</strong>. By taking benefits at <strong>62</strong>, you secure your benefits before any potential rule changes occur.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The Argument for Early Withdrawal</h2>\n<p>Although many financial advisors tell you to wait until <strong>70</strong> to maximize benefits, you need to live well into your <strong>80s</strong> just to make up for the amount you missed out on by delaying from <strong>62</strong> to <strong>70</strong>. Given rising healthcare costs and decreased life expectancy in the US, I’d prefer to take my money while it’s still available.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So I’ve only got one question for you: would you rather gamble on the government getting it right or start collecting while the money’s still there for the taking?</p>\n<p>If any of this is helpful, tune into my new podcast, <strong>Your Money Guide on the Side</strong>, by clicking the link in my bio.</p>",
