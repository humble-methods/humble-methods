  "content": "<h1>5 Essential Steps to Take When You Receive Your Paycheck</h1>\n<p>I'm Tyler. I'm a former financial advisor and portfolio manager. Now I make financial content for free so that you don't have to pay for it.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Calculate Your Monthly Living Expenses</h2>\n<p>Calculate exactly what you expect to live on each month. If that's over 60% of your paycheck, you're living beyond your means. And I've got bad news. It's time to downgrade.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Pay Down High-Interest Debt</h2>\n<p>Take 10% of that paycheck and pay down any high interest debt. Because there is no better way to stay broke than to be fighting an uphill battle against 35% interest rates.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Set Aside Fun Money</h2>\n<p>Take 10% of that paycheck and do whatever the heck you want with it. If it's not fun, it's not going to be sustainable.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Invest Wisely</h2>\n<p>In that remaining 10%, invest, invest, invest! Low cost, diversified index funds equal the only tried and true way to stop living paycheck to paycheck.</p>\n\n<p>If any of this is helpful, like and follow, and I'll keep trying to get you one step closer to where you need to be.</p>",
